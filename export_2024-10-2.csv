After initial lesion formation during active demyelination, inflammation is gradually compartmentalized and restricted to specific tissue areas such as the lesion rim in chronic-active lesions. However, the cell type-specific and spatially restricted drivers of chronic tissue damage and lesion expansion are not well understood. Here, we investigated the properties of subcortical white matter lesions by creating a cell type-specific spatial map of gene expression across various inflammatory lesion stages in MS. An integrated analysis of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data enabled us to uncover patterns of glial, immune and stromal cell subtype diversity, as well as to identify cell-cell communication and signaling signatures across lesion and non-lesion tissue areas in MS. Our results provide insights into the conversion of the tissue microenvironment from a ‘homeostatic’ to a pathogenic or ‘dysfunctional’ state underlying lesion progression in MS. We expect that this study will help identify spatially resolved cell type-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future interventional trials in MS.",bioRxiv,2022.11.03.514906

Dobson,G. Giovannoni",European Journal of Neurology,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest non‐traumatic disabling disease to affect young adults. The incidence of MS is increasing worldwide, together with the socioeconomic impact of the disease. The underlying cause of MS and mechanisms behind this increase remain opaque, although complex gene–environment interactions almost certainly play a significant role. The epidemiology of MS indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood obesity and infection with the Epstein–Barr virus are likely to play a role in disease development. Changes in diagnostic methods and criteria mean that people with MS can be diagnosed increasingly early in their disease trajectory. Alongside this, treatments for MS have increased exponentially in number, efficacy and risk. There is now the possibility of a diagnosis of ‘pre‐symptomatic MS’ being made; as a result potentially preventive strategies could be studied. In this comprehensive review, MS epidemiology, potential aetiological factors and pathology are discussed, before moving on to clinical aspects of MS diagnosis and management.",Eur. J.

Methods: We conducted mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using an instrumental variable (IV) comprising 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms found to be associated with serum 25(OH)D levels at genome-wide significance. We analyzed the effect of the IV on MS risk and both age at onset and disease severity in 2 separate populations using logistic regression models that controlled for sex, year of birth, smoking, education, genetic ancestry, body mass index at age 18–20 years or in 20s, a weighted genetic risk score for 110 known MS-associated variants, and the presence of one or more HLA-DRB1&ast;15:01 alleles. Results: Findings from MR analyses using the IV showed increasing levels of 25(OH)D are associated with a decreased risk of MS in both populations.

Here, to define mechanisms underlying this disabling, progressive neurodegenerative state4–6 and foster development of new therapeutic agents, we used MRI-informed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the edge of demyelinated white matter lesions at various stages of inflammation. We uncovered notable glial and immune cell diversity, especially at the chronically inflamed lesion edge. We define ‘microglia inflamed in MS’ (MIMS) and ‘astrocytes inflamed in MS’, glial phenotypes that demonstrate neurodegenerative programming. The MIMS transcriptional profile overlaps with that of microglia in other neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that primary and secondary neurodegeneration share common mechanisms and could benefit from similar therapeutic approaches. We identify complement component 1q (C1q) as a critical mediator of MIMS activation, validated immunohistochemically in MS tissue, genetically by microglia-specific C1q ablation in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and therapeutically by treating chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with C1q blockade. C1q inhibition is a potential therapeutic avenue to address chronic white matter inflammation, which could be monitored by longitudinal assessment of its dynamic biomarker, paramagnetic rim lesions, using advanced MRI methods.

Ustekinumab doses were 27 mg, 90 mg q8w, 90 mg, or 180 mg; the 90 mg q8w dosage group received placebo substitute at weeks 7 and 15. The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing T1-weighted lesions on serial cranial MRI through week 23. Patients were followed up through week 37. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00207727.FindingsFrom August, 2004, to December, 2006, 249 patients underwent randomisation (49 for placebo; 50 for each ustekinumab group). Ustekinumab treatment did not show a significant reduction in the primary endpoint for any dosage groups versus placebo. At week 37, adverse events occurred in 38 (78%) placebo-treated patients and 170 (85%) ustekinumab-treated patients, with infections most commonly reported. Serious adverse events occurred in one (2%) placebo-treated patient and six (3%) ustekinumab-treated patients. Malignant diseases were reported in two patients shortly after the initiation of ustekinumab treatment; both patients were withdrawn from the trial and given appropriate treatment, which resulted in complete remission. No serious infections, cardiovascular events, or exacerbation of demyelinating events occurred.

Large hemispheric or double hemispheric sections were examined from patients who had died in the course of acute or early relapsing multiple sclerosis. In MS patients exhibiting hypoxia-like lesions [Pattern III; Lucchinetti et al. Ann Neurol (2000) 47: 707–17], focal areas in the white matter showed mild oedema, microglial activation and mild axonal injury in the absence of overt demyelination. In such lesions T-cell infiltration was mild and restricted to the perivascular space. Myeloperoxidase and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase were expressed primarily by microglia, and the activated form of these cells was associated with extracellular deposition of precipitated fibrin. In addition, these lesions showed up-regulation of proteins involved in tissue preconditioning. When active demyelination started, lesions were associated with massive T-cell infiltration and microglia and macrophages expressed all activation markers studied. Similar tissue alterations were found in rats in the pre-demyelinating stage of lesions induced by the focal injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide into the spinal white matter. We suggest that the areas of microglial activation represent an early stage of tissue injury, which precedes the formation of hypoxia-like demyelinated plaques. The findings indicate that mechanisms associated with innate immunity may play a role in the formation of hypoxia-like demyelinating lesions in MS.",Brain,2800-2815,0006-8950,11,130

Although chronic activation of the immune system is a hallmark of the disease, its pathogenesis is poorly understood, while current treatments only ameliorate the disease and may produce severe side effects. Here, we applied a network-based modeling approach based on phosphoproteomic data to uncover the differential activation in signaling wiring between healthy donors, untreated patients, and those under different treatments. Based in the patient-specific networks, we aimed to create a new approach to identify drug combinations that revert signaling to a healthy-like state. We performed ex vivo multiplexed phosphoproteomic assays upon perturbations with multiple drugs and ligands in primary immune cells from 169 subjects (MS patients, n=129 and matched healthy controls, n=40). Patients were either untreated or treated with fingolimod, natalizumab, interferon-β, glatiramer acetate, or the experimental therapy epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). We generated for each donor a dynamic logic model by fitting a bespoke literature-derived network of MS-related pathways to the perturbation data. Last, we developed an approach based on network topology to identify deregulated interactions whose activity could be reverted to a “healthy-like” status by combination therapy. The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS was used to validate the prediction of combination therapies. Analysis of the models uncovered features of healthy-, disease-, and drug-specific signaling networks. We predicted several combinations with approved MS drugs that could revert signaling to a healthy-like state. Specifically, TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) kinase, involved in Transforming growth factor β-1 proprotein (TGF-β), Toll-like receptor, B cell receptor, and response to inflammation pathways, was found to be highly deregulated and co-druggable with all MS drugs studied. One of these predicted combinations, fingolimod with a TAK1 inhibitor, was validated in an animal model of MS. Our approach based on donor-specific signaling networks enables prediction of targets for combination therapy for MS and other complex diseases.",Genome Med.,117,,1,13

A cross-reactive CSF-derived antibody was initially identified by single-cell sequencing of the paired-chain B cell repertoire of MS blood and CSF, followed by protein microarray-based testing of recombinantly expressed CSF-derived antibodies against MS-associated viruses. Sequence analysis, affinity measurements and the crystal structure of the EBNA1–peptide epitope in complex with the autoreactive Fab fragment enabled tracking of the development of the naive EBNA1-restricted antibody to a mature EBNA1–GlialCAM cross-reactive antibody. Molecular mimicry is facilitated by a post-translational modification of GlialCAM. EBNA1 immunization exacerbates disease in a mouse model of MS, and anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies are prevalent in patients with MS.

Dianne Langford,Michael W Graner,Xiaoli Yu",Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), the etiology of which is poorly understood. The most common laboratory abnormality associated with MS is increased intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the major antigenic targets of these antibody responses are unknown. The risk of MS is increased after infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to EBV infection, and MS patients have higher serum titers of anti-EBV antibodies than control populations. Our goal was to identify disease-relevant epitopes of IgG antibodies in MS; to do so, we screened phage-displayed random peptide libraries (12-mer) with total IgG antibodies purified from the brain of a patient with acute MS. We identified and characterized the phage peptides for binding specificity to intrathecal IgG from patients with MS and from controls by ELISA, phage-mediated Immuno-PCR, and isoelectric focusing. We identified two phage peptides that share sequence homologies with EBV nuclear antigens 1 and 2 (EBNA1 and EBNA2), respectively. The specificity of the EBV epitopes found by panning with MS brain IgG was confirmed by ELISA and competitive inhibition assays. Using a highly sensitive phage-mediated immuno-PCR assay, we determined specific bindings of the two EBV epitopes to IgG from CSF from 46 MS and 5 inflammatory control (IC) patients. MS CSF IgG have significantly higher bindings to EBNA1 epitope than to EBNA2 epitope, whereas EBNA1 and EBNA2 did not significantly differ in binding to IC CSF IgG. Further, the EBNA1 epitope was recognized by OCBs from multiple MS CSF as shown in blotting assays with samples separated by isoelectric focusing. The EBNA1 epitope is reactive to MS intrathecal antibodies corresponding to oligoclonal bands. This reinforces the potential role of EBV in the etiology of MS.

Jarius,P. Eichhorn,D. Franciotta,H. F. Petereit,G. Akman-Demir,M. Wick,B. Wildemann",Journal of Neurology,"It has long been known that the majority of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) display an intrathecal, polyspecific humoral immune response to a broad panel of neurotropic viruses. This response has measles virus, rubella virus and varicella zoster virus as its most frequent constituents and is thus referred to as the MRZ reaction (MRZR). Re-evaluation of the specificity of MRZR as a marker of MS. Structured review of the existing English-, German- and Spanish-language literature on MRZR testing, with evaluation of MRZR in a cohort of 43 unselected patients with MS and other neurological diseases as a proof of principle. A positive MRZ reaction, defined as a positive intrathecal response to at least two of the three viral agents, was found in 78% of MS patients but only in 3% of the controls (p < 0.00001), corresponding to specificity of 97%. Median antibody index values were significantly lower in non-MS patients (measles, p < 0.0001; rubella, p < 0.006; varicella zoster, p < 0.02). The 30 identified original studies on MRZR reported results from 1478 individual MRZR tests. A positive MRZR was reported for 458/724 (63.3%) tests in patients with MS but only for 19/754 (2.5%) tests in control patients (p < 0.000001), corresponding to cumulative specificity of 97.5% (CI 95% 96–98.4), cumulative sensitivity of 63.3% (CI 95% 59.6–66.8) (or 67.4% [CI 95% 63.5–71.1] in the adult MS subgroup), a positive likelihood ratio of 25.1 (CI 95% 16–39.3) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.38 (CI 95% 0.34–0.41). Of particular note, MRZR was absent in 52/53 (98.1%) patients with neuromyelitis optica or MOG-IgG-positive encephalomyelitis, two important differential diagnoses of MS. MRZR is the most specific laboratory marker of MS reported to date. If present, MRZR substantially increases the likelihood of the diagnosis of MS.

Here, to address this gap, we analysed 632,000 single nuclei RNAseq profiles of 156 brain tissue samples, comprising white matter (WM) lesions, normal appearing WM, grey matter (GM) lesions and normal appearing GM from 54 MS patients and 26 controls. We observed the expected changes in overall neuronal and glial numbers previously described within the classical lesion subtypes. We found highly cell type-specific gene expression changes in MS tissue, with distinct differences between GM and WM areas, confirming different pathologies. However, surprisingly, we did not observe distinct gene expression signatures for the classical different WM lesion types, rather a continuum of change. This indicates that classical lesion characterization better reflects changes in cell abundance than changes in cell type gene expression, and indicates a global disease effect. Furthermore, the major biological determinants of variability in gene expression in MS WM samples relate to individual patient effects, rather than to lesion types or other metadata. We identify four subgroups of MS patients with distinct WM glial gene expression signatures and patterns of oligodendrocyte stress and/or maturation, suggestive of engagement of different pathological processes, with an additional more variable regenerative astrocyte signature. The discovery of these patterns, which were also found in an independent MS patient cohort, provides a framework to use molecular biomarkers to stratify patients for optimal therapeutic approaches for progressive MS, significantly advances our mechanistic understanding of progressive MS, and highlights the need for precision-medicine approaches to address heterogeneity among MS patients.",bioRxiv,2022.04.06.487263

To gain insights into the interplay between inter- and intra-cellular mechanisms and deconvolute the complex niche of lesion evolution, we have integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data for different white matter (WM) lesions from patients with PMS combined with spatial transcriptomics of chronic active lesion border. The PMS-specific oligodendrocyte genetic program was governed by the KLF/SP gene family involved in myelination and stress-induced iron uptake. The transferrin gene (TF) and its receptor LRP2 were highly expressed across all lesion types in oligodendrocytes suggesting autocrine communication of iron uptake and were co-localized at the outer border of the chronic active lesion. The genomic accessibility of the structural protein (VIM) and the cystine/glutamate antiporter (SLC7A11) was significantly reduced, and the genes were downregulated in oligodendrocytes. We identified oligodendrocytes expressing the osteopontin gene and complement at the outer edge of the chronic active lesion. We describe a metabolic astrocyte phenotype at the lesion border and an astrocytic-neuronal axis through FGF signaling (FGFR3-FGF13) inside the chronic active lesion. We also identified two distinct B cell co-expression networks with different location and gene expression preferring different lesion types. With single cell multi-omics, we were able to get a snapshot of specific cell types with distinctive molecular signatures and pathways, including their interactions and locations contributing to lesion fate."

Baranzini",Nature Reviews Neurology,"During the past decade, research has revealed that the vast community of micro-organisms that inhabit the gut — known as the gut microbiota — is intricately linked to human health and disease, partly as a result of its influence on systemic immune responses. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that these effects on immune function are important in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), and that modulation of the microbiome could be therapeutically beneficial in these conditions. In this Review, we examine the influence that the gut microbiota have on immune function via modulation of serotonin production in the gut and through complex interactions with components of the immune system, such as T cells and B cells. We then present evidence from studies in mice and humans that these effects of the gut microbiota on the immune system are important in the development and course of MS. We also consider how strategies for manipulating the composition of the gut microbiota could be used to influence disease-related immune dysfunction and form the basis of a new class of therapeutics. The strategies discussed include the use of probiotics, supplementation with bacterial metabolites, transplantation of faecal matter or defined microbial communities, and dietary intervention. Carefully designed studies with large human cohorts will be required to gain a full understanding of the microbiome changes involved in MS and to develop therapeutic strategies that target these changes. In this Review, the authors provide detailed insight into how the gut microbiota influences the immune system, with implications for neuroinflammation, and discuss the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiota is an important factor in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target. The colony of bacteria that inhabit the gut — known as the gut microbiota — varies in composition according to genetic factors and, more importantly, envorinmental influences, particularly diet.The composition of the gut microbiota influences the production of serotonin in the gut, which in turn influences serotonin-mediated regulation of systemic immune function.Gut microbiota are also involved in complex interactions with the gut and immune cells in the small intestine and the colon, thereby influencing immune responses in the periphery and the central nervous system.Abundant evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a role in multiple sclerosis (MS) through its influence on immune function.Therapeutic strategies that target the microbiota — including dietary interventions, probiotics, short-chain fatty acids and faecal microbial transplantation — seem promising for the treatment of MS, but further work is needed to assess their effectiveness.

Cohen,Alberto Ascherio",Nature Reviews Neurology,"Epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare complication of infection with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus that infects more than 90% of the global population. This link was long suspected because the risk of MS increases markedly after infectious mononucleosis (symptomatic primary EBV infection) and with high titres of antibodies to specific EBV antigens. However, it was not until 2022 that a longitudinal study demonstrated that MS risk is minimal in individuals who are not infected with EBV and that it increases over 30-fold following EBV infection. Over the past few years, a number of studies have provided clues on the underlying mechanisms, which might help us to develop more targeted treatments for MS. In this Review, we discuss the evidence linking EBV to the development of MS and the mechanisms by which the virus is thought to cause the disease. Furthermore, we discuss implications for the treatment and prevention of MS, including the use of antivirals and vaccines. In this Review, the authors provide an overview of the evidence indicating that multiple sclerosis is a rare complication of infection with the Epstein–Barr virus and discuss the mechanisms that could underlie this association. In a longitudinal study that followed individuals seronegative for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) over time, multiple sclerosis (MS) risk increased more than 30-fold after EBV infection. The results are unlikely to be explained by reverse causation or confounding factors.Among individuals who are EBV positive, those with a history of infectious mononucleosis or with high antibody titres against EBV nuclear antigens have an increased risk of developing MS.Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the link between EBV and MS, including molecular mimicry and an altered immune response to poorly controlled EBV infection.Vaccines that might prevent EBV infection are currently being developed.

Recent studies have provided compelling epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for a causal role of EBV in multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system and is thought to be triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by an infectious agent, with EBV as the lead candidate. How a ubiquitous virus that typically leads to benign latent infections can promote cancer and autoimmune disease in at-risk populations is not fully understood. Here we review the evidence that EBV is a causal agent for MS and how various risk factors may affect EBV infection and immune control. We focus on EBV contributing to MS through reprogramming of latently infected B lymphocytes and the chronic presentation of viral antigens as a potential source of autoreactivity through molecular mimicry. We consider how knowledge of EBV-associated cancers may be instructive for understanding the role of EBV in MS and discuss the potential for therapies that target EBV to treat MS.

Bennett,Philip De Jager,Vilas Menon",bioRxiv,"Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called “normal-appearing” non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age– and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region– and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type– and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes.",bioRxiv,2023.12.20.572491

Attfield,Lars Fugger,Manuel A. Friese",Med,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), can be suppressed in its early stages but eventually becomes clinically progressive and unresponsive to therapy. Here, we investigate whether the therapeutic resistance of progressive MS can be attributed to chronic immune cell accumulation behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Methods We systematically track CNS-homing immune cells in the peripheral blood of 31 MS patients and 31 matched healthy individuals in an integrated analysis of 497,705 single-cell transcriptomes and 355,433 surface protein profiles from 71 samples. Through spatial RNA sequencing, we localize these cells in post mortem brain tissue of 6 progressive MS patients contrasted against 4 control brains (20 samples, 85,000 spot transcriptomes). Findings We identify a specific pathogenic CD161+/lymphotoxin beta (LTB)+ T cell population that resides in brains of progressive MS patients. Intriguingly, our data suggest that the colonization of the CNS by these T cells may begin earlier in the disease course, as they can be mobilized to the blood by usage of the integrin-blocking antibody natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS patients.

However, so far little is known regarding the phenotype and function of these infiltrating lymphocyte populations. In this study, we performed an in-depth phenotypic characterization of T and B cell infiltrates in a large set of multiple sclerosis cases with different disease and lesion stages and compared the findings with those seen in inflammatory, non-inflammatory and normal human controls. In multiple sclerosis lesions, we found a dominance of CD8+ T cells and a prominent contribution of CD20+ B cells in all disease courses and lesion stages, including acute multiple sclerosis cases with very short disease duration, while CD4+ T cells were sparse. A dominance of CD8+ T cells was also seen in other inflammatory controls, such as Rasmussen’s encephalitis and viral encephalitis, but the contribution of B cells in these diseases was modest. Phenotypic analysis of the CD8+ T cells suggested that part of the infiltrating cells in active lesions proliferate, show an activated cytotoxic phenotype and are in part destroyed by apoptosis. Further characterization of the remaining cells suggest that CD8+ T cells acquire features of tissue-resident memory cells, which may be focally reactivated in active lesions of acute, relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis, while B cells, at least in part, gradually transform into plasma cells. The loss of surface molecules involved in the egress of leucocytes from inflamed tissue, such as S1P1 or CCR7, and the upregulation of CD103 expression may be responsible for the compartmentalization of the inflammatory response in established lesions. Similar phenotypic changes of tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were also seen in Rasmussen’s encephalitis. Our data underline the potential importance of CD8+ T lymphocytes and B cells in the inflammatory response in established multiple sclerosis lesions. Tissue-resident T and B cells may represent guardians of previous inflammatory brain disease, which can be reactivated and sustain the inflammatory response, when they are re-exposed to their specific antigen.",Brain,2066-2082,0006-8950,7,141

In susceptibility-based magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T, iron-laden microglia/macrophages induce a rim of decreased signal at lesion edges and have been associated with slowly expanding lesions. We aimed to determine (1) what lesion types and stages are associated with iron accumulation at their edges, (2) what cells at the lesion edges accumulate iron and what is their activation status, (3) how reliably can iron accumulation at the lesion edge be detected by 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (4) if lesions with rims enlarge over time in vivo, when compared to lesions without rims. Double-hemispheric brain sections of 28 MS cases were stained for iron, myelin, and microglia/macrophages. Prior to histology, 4 of these 28 cases were imaged at 7 T using post-mortem susceptibility-weighted imaging. In vivo, seven MS patients underwent annual neurological examinations and 7 T MRI for 3.5 years, using a fluid attenuated inversion recovery/susceptibility-weighted imaging fusion sequence. Pathologically, we found iron rims around slowly expanding and some inactive lesions but hardly around remyelinated shadow plaques. Iron in rims was mainly present in microglia/macrophages with a pro-inflammatory activation status, but only very rarely in astrocytes. Histological validation of post-mortem susceptibility-weighted imaging revealed a quantitative threshold of iron-laden microglia when a rim was visible. Slowly expanding lesions significantly exceeded this threshold, when compared with inactive lesions (p = 0.003). We show for the first time that rim lesions significantly expanded in vivo after 3.5 years, compared to lesions without rims (p = 0.003). Thus, slow expansion of MS lesions with rims, which reflects chronic lesion activity, may, in the future, become an MRI marker for disease activity in MS.",Acta Neuropathol.,25-42,0001-6322,1,133

These features are supported by experimental evidence, which demonstrates that fundamentally different processes, such as autoimmunity or virus infection, may induce MS‐like inflammatory demyelinating plaques and suggest that MS may be a disease with heterogeneous pathogenetic mechanisms. From a large pathology sample of MS, collected in three international centers, we selected 51 biopsies and 32 autopsies that contained actively demyelinating lesions defined by stringent criteria. The pathology of the lesions was analyzed using a broad spectrum of immunological and neurobiological markers. Four fundamentally different patterns of demyelination were found, defined on the basis of myelin protein loss, the geography and extension of plaques, the patterns of oligodendrocyte destruction, and the immunopathological evidence of complement activation. Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T‐cell–mediated or T‐cell plus antibody–mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus‐ or toxin‐induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity. At a given time point of the disease—as reflected in autopsy cases—the patterns of demyelination were heterogeneous between patients, but were homogenous within multiple active lesions from the same patient. This pathogenetic heterogeneity of plaques from different MS patients may have fundamental implications for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease. Ann Neurol 2000;47:707–717",Ann.

However, the exact mechanisms how they contribute to disability are yet not completely known. Strategic lesion location may be an important factor concerning the impact of focal lesions on clinical disability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution of IRLs compared to non-IRLs and their impact on disability. Methods We retrospectively identified 67 patients with at least one IRL on MRI and 67 age- and sex-matched patients without IRLs. We compared the spatial distribution of lesions between both groups and between IRLs and non-IRLs in patients with IRLs. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between lesion localisation and disability on a voxel-by-voxel basis and investigated the impact on structural network disruptions. Results Patients with IRLs had higher disability scores (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score (range): 3.0 (0 – 8.5) versus 1.5 (0 – 6.5); p = 0.001; median pyramidal functional system score (range): 1.0 (0 – 5) versus 0 (0 – 4); p = 0.003), significantly lower brain volumes (mean normal-appearing grey matter volume: 749.66 ± 60.58 versus 785.83 ± 53.71 mL; mean normal-appearing white matter volume: 723.58 ± 60.13 versus 753.25 ± 69.61 mL; mean deep grey matter volume: 33.21 ± 4.19 versus 35.85 ± 4.89 mL; p < 0.05 for all comparisons) and a significantly higher total T2 lesion volume (mean: 9.96 ± 11.6 versus 4.31 ± 8.9 mL; p < 0.001). We found no neuroanatomical regions that were more often affected by IRLs. Furthermore, comparing the overall network disruption in the IRL group, IRLs caused less network disruption/mL lesion size compared to non-IRLs (1.54% / mL versus 2.0% / mL; p < 0.05). Conclusion IRLs are associated with higher disability scores. However, our results suggest that a higher disability is not explained by the sheer topography of IRLs or their network disruption.",Mult. Scler. Relat. Disord.,103967,2211-0348,,64

These patterns were suggested to represent heterogeneity of the underlying pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether lesion heterogeneity also exists in an unselected collection of autopsy material from patients with established MS. All MS brain tissue available in the VU Medical Center was assessed for the presence of active demyelinating lesions using magnetic resonance imaging–guided sampling and immunohistochemistry. Tissue blocks containing active demyelinating lesions were evaluated for the presence of complement and antibody deposition, oligodendrocyte apoptosis, differential loss of myelin proteins, and hypoxia‐like damage using histology, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Blocks with active demyelinating lesions were compared with blocks with active (nondemyelinating) and inactive lesions. Complement and antibodies were consistently associated with macrophages in areas of active demyelination. Preferential loss of myelin proteins, extensive hypoxia‐like damage, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis were absent or rare. This pattern was observed in all tissue blocks containing active demyelinating lesions; lesion heterogeneity between patients was not found. The immunopathological appearance of active demyelinating lesions in established MS is uniform. Initial heterogeneity of demyelinating lesions in the earliest phase of MS lesion formation may disappear over time as different pathways converge in one general mechanism of demyelination. Consistent presence of complement, antibodies, and Fcγ receptors in phagocytic macrophages suggests that antibody‐ and complement‐mediated myelin phagocytosis is the dominant mechanism of demyelination in established MS.

M. Cortese,Daniel S. Reich",JAMA Neurology,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic active lesions, which previously could only be detected at autopsy, can now be identified on susceptibility-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo as non–gadolinium-enhancing lesions with paramagnetic rims. Pathologically, they feature smoldering inflammatory demyelination at the edge, remyelination failure, and axonal degeneration. To our knowledge, the prospect of long-term in vivo monitoring makes it possible for the first time to determine their contribution to disability and value as a treatment target. To assess whether rim lesions are associated with patient disability and long-term lesion outcomes. We performed 3 studies at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center: (1) a prospective clinical/radiological cohort of 209 patients with MS (diagnosis according to the 2010 McDonald revised MS criteria, age ≥18 years, with 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI results) who were enrolled from January 2012 to March 2018 (of 209, 17 patients [8%] were excluded because of uninterpretable MRI scans); (2) a radiological/pathological analysis of expanding lesions featuring rims; and (3) a retrospective longitudinal radiological study assessing long-term lesion evolution in 23 patients with MS with yearly MRI scans for 10 years or more (earliest scan, 1992). (1) Identification of chronic rim lesions on 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI in 192 patients with MS and the association of rim counts with clinical disability (primary analysis) and brain volume changes (exploratory analysis). (2) Pathological characterization of 10 expanding lesions from an adult with progressive MS who came to autopsy after 7 years of receiving serial in vivo MRI scans. (3) Evaluation of annual lesion volume change (primary analysis) and T1 times (exploratory analysis) in 27 rim lesions vs 27 rimless lesions. Of 209 participants, 104 (50%) were women and 32 (15%) were African American. One hundred seventeen patients (56%) had at least 1 rim lesion regardless of prior or ongoing treatment. Further, 84 patients (40%) had no rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [14] years), 66 (32%) had 1 to 3 rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years), and 42 (20%) had 4 rims or more (mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years). Individuals with 4 rim lesions or more reached motor and cognitive disability at an earlier age. Normalized volumes of brain, white matter, and basal ganglia were lower in those with rim lesions. Whereas rimless lesions shrank over time (−3.6%/year), rim lesions were stable in size or expanded (2.2%/year; P < .001). Rim lesions had longer T1 times, suggesting more tissue destruction, than rimless lesions. On histopathological analysis, all 10 rim lesions that expanded in vivo had chronic active inflammation. Chronic active lesions are common, are associated with more aggressive disease, exert ongoing tissue damage, and occur even in individuals treated with effective disease-modifying therapies.

D. Henderson,Michael H. Barnett,John D. E. Parratt,John W. Prineas",Annals of Neurology,"CD4 T‐cell–dependent macrophage activation directed against a myelin or oligodendrocyte antigen is generally thought to be the mechanism causing myelin destruction in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, areas within expanding MS lesions may exhibit prominent oligodendrocyte loss and apoptosis in the absence of infiltrating lymphocytes. The present study was designed to further investigate the inflammatory profile of different regions within rapidly expanding MS lesions. Twenty‐six active lesions from 11 patients with early MS were serially sectioned and immunostained for T and B cells, plasma cells, ramified microglia, macrophages, monocytes, and CD209‐positive dendritic cells. Cell counts were compared in prephagocytic, phagocytic, and immediately postphagocytic areas. Parenchymal T and B cells were largely absent in areas of initial oligodendrocyte loss and in areas of degenerate and dead myelin infiltrated by myelin phagocytes. In contrast, trailing areas of complete demyelination packed with lipid macrophages, and, in some lesions, regenerating oligodendrocytes, showed large numbers of T cells, B cells, and immunoglobulin G (IgG)‐positive plasma cells. Lesions in 2 exceptionally early cases contained relatively few T and B cells, and no IgG‐positive plasma cells. Early loss of oligodendrocytes is a prominent feature in tissue bordering rapidly expanding MS lesions. Macrophage activity is largely an innate scavenging response to the presence of degenerate and dead myelin. Adaptive immune activity involving T and B cells is conspicuous chiefly in recently demyelinated tissue, which may show signs of oligodendrocyte regeneration. The findings suggest that plaque formation has some basis other than destructive cell‐mediated immunity directed against a myelin or oligodendrocyte antigen. Ann Neurol 2009;66:739–753",Ann.

These paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are associated with clinical worsening, although the cell type-specific and molecular pathways of iron uptake and metabolism are not well known. We studied two postmortem cohorts: an exploratory formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue cohort of 18 controls and 24 MS cases and a confirmatory snap-frozen cohort of 6 controls and 14 MS cases. Besides myelin and non-heme iron imaging, the haptoglobin-hemoglobin scavenger receptor CD163, the iron-metabolizing markers HMOX1 and HAMP as well as immune-related markers P2RY12, CD68, C1QA and IL10 were visualized in myeloid cell (MC) subtypes at RNA and protein levels across different MS lesion areas. In addition, we studied PRLs in vivo in a cohort of 98 people with MS (pwMS) via iron-sensitive 3 T MRI and haptoglobin genotyping by PCR. CSF samples were available from 38 pwMS for soluble CD163 (sCD163) protein level measurements by ELISA. In postmortem tissues, we observed that iron uptake was linked to rim-associated C1QA-expressing MC subtypes, characterized by upregulation of CD163, HMOX1, HAMP and, conversely, downregulation of P2RY12. We found that pwMS with ≥ 4 PRLs had higher sCD163 levels in the CSF than pwMS with ≤ 3 PRLs with sCD163 correlating with the number of PRLs. The number of PRLs was associated with clinical worsening but not with age, sex or haptoglobin genotype of pwMS. However, pwMS with Hp2-1/Hp2-2 haplotypes had higher clinical disability scores than pwMS with Hp1-1. In summary, we observed upregulation of the CD163-HMOX1-HAMP axis in MC subtypes at chronic active lesion rims, suggesting haptoglobin-bound hemoglobin but not transferrin-bound iron as a critical source for MC-associated iron uptake in MS. The correlation of CSF-associated sCD163 with PRL counts in MS highlights the relevance of CD163-mediated iron uptake via haptoglobin-bound hemoglobin. Also, while Hp haplotypes had no noticeable influence on PRL counts, pwMS carriers of a Hp2 allele might have a higher risk to experience clinical worsening.",Acta Neuropathol.,707-724,0001-6322,5,146

We identified 479 differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells, 435 in monocytes, and 54 in CD8+ T cells. Importantly, in CD4+ T cells, we discovered upregulated transcripts from the NAE1 gene, a critical subunit of the NEDD8 activating enzyme, which activates the neddylation pathway, a post-translational modification analogous to ubiquitination. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme using the specific inhibitor pevonedistat (MLN4924) significantly ameliorated disease severity in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Development MS diagnosis relies on the integration of clinical, imaging and laboratory findings as there is still no singlepathognomonicclinical feature or diagnostic laboratory biomarker. The most commonly laboratory test used is the presence of immunoglobulin G oligoclonal bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. This test is now included in the 2017 McDonald criteria as a biomarker of dissemination in time. Nevertheless, there are other biomarkers currently in use such as kappa free light chain, which has shown higher sensitivity and specificity for MS diagnosis than OCB. In addition, other potential laboratory tests involved in neuronal damage, demyelination and/or inflammation could be used for detecting MS.

Studies on monozygotic twins discordant for MS offer a unique way to reduce this complexity and reveal discrepant subsets. Methods In this study, we analyzed B cell subsets in blood samples of monozygotic twins with and without MS using publicly available data. We verified functional characteristics by exploring the role of therapy and performed separate analyses in unrelated individuals. Findings The frequencies of CXCR3+ memory B cells were reduced in the blood of genetically identical twins with MS compared to their unaffected twin siblings. Natalizumab (anti-VLA-4 antibody) was the only treatment regimen under which these frequencies were reversed. The CNS-homing features of CXCR3+ memory B cells were supported by elevated CXCL10 levels in MS cerebrospinal fluid and their in vitro propensity to develop into antibody-secreting cells. Conclusions Circulating CXCR3+ memory B cells are affected by non-heritable cues in people who develop MS. This underlines the requirement of environmental risk factors such as Epstein-Barr virus in triggering these B cells. We propose that after CXCL10-mediated entry into the CNS, CXCR3+ memory B cells mature into antibody-secreting cells to drive MS.

Reudelhuber,Alexandre Prat",The Journal of Neuroscience,"The blood–brain barrier (BBB) restricts molecular and cellular trafficking between the blood and the CNS. Although astrocytes are known to control BBB permeability, the molecular determinants of this effect remain unknown. We show that angiotensinogen (AGT) produced and secreted by astrocytes is cleaved into angiotensin II (AngII) and acts on type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT1) expressed by BBB endothelial cells (ECs). Activation of AT1 restricts the passage of molecular tracers across human BBB-derived ECs through threonine-phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin and its mobilization to lipid raft membrane microdomains. We also show that AGT knock-out animals have disorganized occludin strands at the level of the BBB and a diffuse accumulation of the endogenous serum protein plasminogen in the CNS, compared with wild-type animals. Finally, we demonstrate a reduction in the number of AGT-immunopositive perivascular astrocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, which correlates with a reduced expression of occludin similarly seen in the CNS of AGT knock-out animals. Such a reduction in astrocyte-expressed AGT and AngII is dependent, in vitro, on the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ. Our study defines a novel physiological role for AngII in the CNS and suggests that inflammation-induced downregulation of AngII production by astrocytes is involved in BBB dysfunction in MS lesions."," J.

Successful use of CD19 CAR-T cells in rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and neuroimmunological diseases like myasthenia gravis have recently been observed, suggesting possible application in other autoimmune diseases. Methods Here, we report the first individual treatment with a fully human CD19 CAR-T cell therapy (KYV-101) in two patients with progressive MS. Findings CD19 CAR-T cell administration resulted in acceptable safety profiles for both patients. No ICANS was observed despite detection of CD19 CAR-T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. In case 1, intrathecal antibody production in the cerebrospinal fluid decreased notably after CAR-T cell infusion and was sustained through day 64. Conclusions CD19 CAR-T cell administration in progressive MS resulted in an acceptable safety profile. CAR-T cell presence and expansion were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid without clinical signs of neurotoxicity, which, along with intrathecal antibody reduction, indicates expansion-dependent effects of CAR-T cells on CD19+ target cells in the CNS. Larger clinical studies assessing CD19 CAR-T cells in MS are warranted. Funding Both individual treatments as well the generated data were not based on external funding.",Med,550-558.e2,2666-6340,6,5

Frisch,Roxanne Pretzsch,Martin S. Weber",Neurotherapeutics,"Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, still represents one of the most common causes of persisting disability with an early disease onset. Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS—namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly. Finally, we cover the current knowledge on repopulation of CD20+ cells after cessation of anti-CD20 treatment and discuss future aspirations towards alternative, further developed B cell silencing therapies.",Neurotherapeutics,1602-1622,1933-7213,3,18

A new finding is the differential distribution of CCL8 marker alleles and a haplotype in extreme severity subgroups of MS. In SLE, this study reveals strong associations with a marker and a haplotype encompassing the CCL14 gene, which suggests that a lupus relevant variant may lie within or in the proximity of this haplotype.",J.

Kooistra",Acta Neuropathologica Communications,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by inflammation and focal areas of demyelination, ultimately resulting in axonal degradation and neuronal loss. Several lines of evidence point towards a role for microglia and other brain macrophages in disease initiation and progression, but exactly how lesion formation is triggered is currently unknown. Here, we characterized early changes in MS brain tissue through transcriptomic analysis of normal appearing white matter (NAWM). We found that NAWM was characterized by enriched expression of genes associated with inflammation and cellular stress derived from brain macrophages. Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed a stress response in brain macrophages in NAWM and identified specific microglia and macrophage subsets at different stages of demyelinating lesions. We identified both phagocytic/activated microglia and CAM clusters that were associated with various MS lesion types. These overall changes in microglia and macrophages associated with lesion development in MS brain tissue may provide therapeutic targets to limit lesion progression and demyelination.",Acta Neuropathol.

Leibovitch,Joan Ohayon,Tianxia Wu,Alessandro Meani,Massimo Filippi,Steven Jacobson,Irene C.M. Cortese,Daniel S. Reich",Journal of Clinical Investigation,"BACKGROUND. In some active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, a strong immune reaction at the lesion edge may contain growth and thereby isolate the lesion from the surrounding parenchyma. Our previous studies suggest that this process involves opening of the blood-brain barrier in capillaries at the lesion edge, seen on MRI as centripetal contrast enhancement and a colocalized phase rim. We hypothesized that using these features to characterize early lesion evolution will allow in vivo tracking of tissue degeneration and/or repair, thus improving the evaluation of potential therapies for chronic active lesions. METHODS. Centripetally and centrifugally enhancing lesions were studied in 17 patients with MS using 7-tesla MRI. High-resolution, susceptibility-weighted, T1-weighted (before/after gadolinium), and dynamic contrast–enhanced scans were acquired at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, and 12. For each lesion, time evolution of the phase rim, lesion volume, and T1 hypointensity were assessed. In autopsies of 3 progressive MS cases, the histopathology of the phase rim was determined. RESULTS. In centripetal lesions, a phase rim colocalized with initial contrast enhancement. In 12 of 22, this phase rim persisted after enhancement resolved. Compared with centripetal lesions with transient rim, those with persistent rim had less volume shrinkage and became more T1 hypointense between months 3 and 12. No centrifugal lesions developed phase rims at any time point. Pathologically, persistent rims corresponded to an iron-laden inflammatory myeloid cell population at the edge of chronic demyelinated lesions. CONCLUSION. In early lesion evolution, a persistent phase rim in lesions that shrink least and become more T1 hypointense over time suggests that the rim might mark failure of early lesion repair and/or irreversible tissue damage. In later stages of MS, phase rim lesions continue to smolder, exerting detrimental effects on affected brain tissue. TRIAL REGISTRATION. NCT00001248. FUNDING.
