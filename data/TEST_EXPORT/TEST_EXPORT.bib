  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system in young adults. This disorder is a heterogeneous, multifactorial, immune-mediated disease that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. In most patients, reversible episodes of neurological dysfunction lasting several days or weeks characterize the initial stages of the disease (that is, clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing--remitting MS). Over time, irreversible clinical and cognitive deficits develop. A minority of patients have a progressive disease course from the onset. The pathological hallmark of MS is the formation of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which can be associated with neuro-axonal damage. Focal lesions are thought to be caused by the infiltration of immune cells, including T cells, B cells and myeloid cells, into the central nervous system parenchyma, with associated injury. MS is associated with a substantial burden on society owing to the high cost of the available treatments and poorer employment prospects and job retention for patients and their caregivers.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects worldwide about 2.5 million people. The morphological correlates of the disease are multiple lesions in brain and spinal cord which are characterized by demyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal damage. The underlying cause for the permanent neurological deficits in MS patients is axonal loss. Demyelinated axons are prone to damage due to the lack of trophic support by myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes, as well as the increased vulnerability to immune mediated attacks. Remyelination occurs, but especially in chronic lesions is frequently limited to a small rim at the lesion border. Current treatment strategies are based on anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory drugs and have the potential to reduce the numbers of newly evolving lesions, although as yet no treatment strategy exists to influence or prevent the progressive disease phase. Therefore, the development of neuroprotective treatment options, such as the promotion of endogenous remyelination is an attractive strategy. A prerequisite for the development of such new treatments is the understanding of the mechanisms leading to remyelination and the reasons for insufficient endogenous repair in chronic MS. This review will therefore provide an overview of the current concepts regarding remyelination in the rodent and human CNS. We will also summarize a selected number of inhibitory pathways and non-disease related factors which may contribute to remyelination failure in chronic MS.},

  abstract = {High-throughput 3{$\prime$} single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows cost-effective, detailed characterization of individual immune cells from tissues. Current techniques, however, are limited in their ability to elucidate essential immune cell features, including variable sequences of T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that confer antigen specificity. Here, we present a strategy that enables simultaneous analysis of TCR sequences and corresponding full transcriptomes from 3{$\prime$}-barcoded scRNA-seq samples. This approach is compatible with common 3{$\prime$} scRNA-seq methods, and adaptable to processed samples post hoc. We applied the technique to identify transcriptional signatures associated with T cells sharing common TCRs from immunized mice and from patients with food allergy. We observed preferential phenotypes among subsets of expanded clonotypes, including type 2 helper CD4+ T cell (TH2) states associated with food allergy. These results demonstrate the utility of our method when studying diseases in which clonotype-driven responses are critical to understanding the underlying biology.},

  abstract = {Dual TCR T cells are a common and natural product of TCR gene rearrangement and thymocyte development. As much as one third of the T cell population may have the capability to express two different TCR specificities on the cell surface. This discovery provoked a reconsideration of the classic model of thymic selection. Many potential roles for dual TCR T cells have since been hypothesized, including posing an autoimmune hazard, dominating alloreactive T cell responses, inducing allergy, and expanding the TCR repertoire to improve protective immunity. Yet, since the initial wave of publications following the discovery of dual TCR T cells, research in the area has slowed. In this study, we aim to provide a brief but comprehensive history of dual TCR T cell research, re-evaluate past observations in the context of current knowledge of the immune system, and identify key issues for future study.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) in humans is characterized by formation of immune-rich granulomas in infected tissues, the architecture and composition of which are thought to affect disease outcome. However, our understanding of the spatial relationships that control human granulomas is limited. Here, we used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) to image 37 proteins in tissues from patients with active TB. We constructed a comprehensive atlas that maps 19 cell subsets across 8 spatial microenvironments. This atlas shows an IFN-{$\gamma$}-depleted microenvironment enriched for TGF-{$\beta$}, regulatory T cells and IDO1+ PD-L1+ myeloid cells. In a further transcriptomic meta-analysis of peripheral blood from patients with TB, immunoregulatory trends mirror those identified by granuloma imaging. Notably, PD-L1 expression is associated with progression to active TB and treatment response. These data indicate that in TB granulomas, there are local spatially coordinated immunoregulatory programs with systemic manifestations that define active TB.},

  abstract = {The diversity of antigen receptors and the specificity it underlies are the hallmarks of the cellular arm of the adaptive immune system. T and B lymphocytes are indeed truly unique in their ability to generate receptors capable of recognizing virtually any pathogen. It has been known for several decades that T lymphocytes recognize short peptides derived from degraded proteins presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at the cell surface. Interaction between peptide-MHC (pMHC) and the T cell receptor (TCR) is central to both thymic selection and peripheral antigen recognition. It is widely assumed that TCR diversity is required, or at least highly desirable, to provide sufficient immune coverage. However, a number of immune responses are associated with the selection of predictable, narrow, or skewed repertoires and public TCR chains. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the formation of the TCR repertoire and its maintenance in health and disease. We also outline the various molecular mechanisms that govern the composition of the pre-selection, naive and antigen-specific TCR repertoires. Finally, we suggest that with the development of high-throughput sequencing, common TCR `signatures' raised against specific antigens could provide important diagnostic biomarkers and surrogate predictors of disease onset, progression and outcome.},
