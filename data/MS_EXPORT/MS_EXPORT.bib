  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss and progressive neurodegeneration. To understand MS lesion initiation and progression, we generate spatial gene expression maps of white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) MS lesions. In different MS lesion types, we detect domains characterized by a distinct gene signature, including an identifiable rim around active WM lesions. Expression changes in astrocyte-specific, oligodendrocyte-specific and microglia-specific gene sets characterize the active lesion rims. Furthermore, we identify three WM lesion progression trajectories, predicting how normal-appearing WM can develop into WM active or mixed active--inactive lesions. Our data shed light on the dynamic progression of MS lesions. Lesion initiation and progression in multiple sclerosis is a dynamic but unclear process. Here, the authors highlight cell type-specific gene sets characterizing the action lesion rims and identify trajectories, predicting how normal-appearing white matter can develop into active and mixed active/inactive lesions.},

Inflammation is gradually compartmentalized and restricted to specific tissue niches such as the lesion rim. However, the precise cell type composition of such niches, their interactions and changes between chronic active and inactive stages are incompletely understood. We used single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics from subcortical MS and corresponding control tissues to map cell types and associated pathways to lesion and nonlesion areas. We identified niches such as perivascular spaces, the inflamed lesion rim or the lesion core that are associated with the glial scar and a cilia-forming astrocyte subtype. Focusing on the inflamed rim of chronic active lesions, we uncovered cell--cell communication events between myeloid, endothelial and glial cell types. Our results provide insight into the cellular composition, multicellular programs and intercellular communication in tissue niches along the conversion from a homeostatic to a dysfunctional state underlying lesion progression in MS. Lerma-Martin et al. generated a paired single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics dataset from subcortical multiple sclerosis lesions, identifying spatial niches and key cell interactions driving inflammation and disease progression at the lesion rim.},

  abstract = {Cells acting at the intersection of immunity                            For years, scientists divided the immune system into two arms: innate and adaptive. The cell types involved in the two arms differ in specificity and in how quickly they respond to infections. More recently, immunologists discovered a family of immune cells termed ``innate lymphoid cells,'' which straddle these two arms. Eberl               et al.               review current understanding of innate lymphoid cells. Like innate immune cells, they respond to infection quickly and do not express antigen receptors; however, they secrete a similar suite of inflammatory mediators as T lymphocytes. Better understanding of the processes regulating these cells may allow for their therapeutic manipulation.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.aaa6566                        ,              A growing family of immune cells reacts promptly to signals from infected or injured tissues and tailors the immune response.           ,                             BACKGROUND                                Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a growing family of immune cells that mirror the phenotypes and functions of T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells can be considered the innate counterparts of cytotoxic CD8                 +                 T cells, whereas ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s may represent the innate counterparts of CD4                 +                 T helper 1 (T                 H                 1), T                 H                 2, and T                 H                 17 cells. However, in contrast to T cells, ILCs do not express antigen receptors or undergo clonal selection and expansion when stimulated. Instead, ILCs react promptly to signals from infected or injured tissues and produce an array of secreted proteins, termed cytokines, that direct the developing immune response into one that is adapted to the original insult. Thus, the power of ILCs may be controlled or unleashed to regulate or enhance immune responses in disease prevention and therapy.                                                        ADVANCES                                As with B cells and T cells, ILCs develop from the common lymphoid progenitor, but dedicated transcription factors supress the B and T cell fates and direct the generation of the different types of ILCs. ILC precursors may migrate from their primary site of production into infected and injured tissues, where they complete their maturation, similar to the differentiation of na{\"i}ve T cells into T                 H                 effectors. Cytokines produced by local cells as well as stress ligands and bacterial and dietary compounds regulate the maturation and activation of ILCs into effectors that play a major role in early immune responses to pathogens and symbionts, helminths, and allergen. The cytokines they produce induce innate responses in stromal, epithelial, and myeloid cells and regulate the activity of dendritic cells (DCs), which play a central role in the cross-talk between ILCs and T cells. In particular, ILCs activate tissue-resident DCs to migrate to lymph nodes, where they elicit specific T cell responses, which in turn regulate ILCs. ILCs also directly regulate T cells through the presentation of peptide antigens on major histocompatibility complex II. However, ILCs are also involved in immunopathology, during which their production of cytokines exacerbates the inflammatory process.                              ILCs also play an intriguing role beyond immunity. In adipose tissues, they regulate thermogenesis and prevent local inflammation that may lead to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and obesity-associated asthma. The functions of ILCs in host metabolism are a new area of research that will lead to insights into how the immune system is implicated in host functions not directly related to defense. Furthermore, ILCs are involved in repair responses upon infection and injury of epithelial cells, stromal cells, and stem cells.                                         OUTLOOK               A logical next step will be the identification of molecules that allow manipulation of ILCs and the orchestration of the optimal immune response after vaccination and immunotherapy---or in contrast, to block detrimental responses. The combination of a prompt activation of ILCs with both effector and regulatory functions, with the expansion of antigen-specific B and T cells, should lead to new and powerful avenues in clinical immunology.                                                   Signals from injured or infected tissues expand and activate NK cells, ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s.                                        The effector functions of ILCs mirror the functions of CD8                     +                     and CD4                     +                     T cells, with the major difference being the prompt activation of ILCs and their lack of (relatively slow) antigen-dependent clonal selection and expansion.                                                                                            ,              Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a growing family of immune cells that mirror the phenotypes and functions of T cells. However, in contrast to T cells, ILCs do not express acquired antigen receptors or undergo clonal selection and expansion when stimulated. Instead, ILCs react promptly to signals from infected or injured tissues and produce an array of secreted proteins termed cytokines that direct the developing immune response into one that is adapted to the original insult. The complex cross-talk between microenvironment, ILCs, and adaptive immunity remains to be fully deciphered. Only by understanding these complex regulatory networks can the power of ILCs be controlled or unleashed in order to regulate or enhance immune responses in disease prevention and therapy.},

Stem cell ageing underlies the ageing of tissues, especially those with a high cellular turnover. There is growing evidence that the ageing of the immune system is initiated at the very top of the haematopoietic hierarchy and that the ageing of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) directly contributes to changes in the immune system, referred to as immunosenescence. In this Review, we summarize the phenotypes of ageing HSCs and discuss how the cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms of HSC ageing might promote immunosenescence. Stem cell ageing has long been considered to be irreversible. However, recent findings indicate that several molecular pathways could be targeted to rejuvenate HSCs and thus to reverse some aspects of immunosenescence.},

After initial lesion formation during active demyelination, inflammation is gradually compartmentalized and restricted to specific tissue areas such as the lesion rim in chronic-active lesions. However, the cell type-specific and spatially restricted drivers of chronic tissue damage and lesion expansion are not well understood. Here, we investigated the properties of subcortical white matter lesions by creating a cell type-specific spatial map of gene expression across various inflammatory lesion stages in MS. An integrated analysis of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data enabled us to uncover patterns of glial, immune and stromal cell subtype diversity, as well as to identify cell-cell communication and signaling signatures across lesion and non-lesion tissue areas in MS. Our results provide insights into the conversion of the tissue microenvironment from a `homeostatic' to a pathogenic or `dysfunctional' state underlying lesion progression in MS. We expect that this study will help identify spatially resolved cell type-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future interventional trials in MS.},

The incidence of               MS               is increasing worldwide, together with the socioeconomic impact of the disease. The underlying cause of               MS               and mechanisms behind this increase remain opaque, although complex gene--environment interactions almost certainly play a significant role. The epidemiology of               MS               indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood obesity and infection with the Epstein--Barr virus are likely to play a role in disease development.

Alongside this, treatments for               MS               have increased exponentially in number, efficacy and risk.

  abstract = {Objective: We sought to estimate the causal effect of low serum 25(OH)D on multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility that is not confounded by environmental or lifestyle factors or subject to reverse causality. Methods: We conducted mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using an instrumental variable (IV) comprising 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms found to be associated with serum 25(OH)D levels at genome-wide significance. We analyzed the effect of the IV on MS risk and both age at onset and disease severity in 2 separate populations using logistic regression models that controlled for sex, year of birth, smoking, education, genetic ancestry, body mass index at age 18--20 years or in 20s, a weighted genetic risk score for 110 known MS-associated variants, and the presence of one or more HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles. Results: Findings from MR analyses using the IV showed increasing levels of 25(OH)D are associated with a decreased risk of MS in both populations. In white, non-Hispanic members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (1,056 MS cases and 9,015 controls), the odds ratio (OR) was 0.79 (p 5 0.04, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.64--0.99). In members of a Swedish population from the Epidemiological Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis and Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis MS case-control studies (6,335 cases and 5,762 controls), the OR was 0.86 (p 5 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.76--0.98). A meta-analysis of the 2 populations gave a combined OR of 0.85 (p 5 0.003, 95\% CI: 0.76--0.94). No association was observed for age at onset or disease severity. Conclusions: These results provide strong evidence that low serum 25(OH)D concentration is a cause of MS, independent of established risk factors.

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions that do not resolve in the months after they form harbour ongoing demyelination and axon degeneration, and are identifiable in vivo by their paramagnetic rims on MRI scans1--3. Here, to define mechanisms underlying this disabling, progressive neurodegenerative state4--6 and foster development of new therapeutic agents, we used MRI-informed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the edge of demyelinated white matter lesions at various stages of inflammation. We uncovered notable glial and immune cell diversity, especially at the chronically inflamed lesion edge. We define `microglia inflamed in MS' (MIMS) and `astrocytes inflamed in MS', glial phenotypes that demonstrate neurodegenerative programming. The MIMS transcriptional profile overlaps with that of microglia in other neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that primary and secondary neurodegeneration share common mechanisms and could benefit from similar therapeutic approaches. We identify complement component 1q (C1q) as a critical mediator of MIMS activation, validated immunohistochemically in MS tissue, genetically by microglia-specific C1q ablation in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and therapeutically by treating chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with C1q blockade. C1q inhibition is a potential therapeutic avenue to address chronic white matter inflammation, which could be monitored by longitudinal assessment of its dynamic biomarker, paramagnetic rim lesions, using advanced MRI methods. Single-nucleus transcriptomics defines a diverse set of immune and glial cells at the chronically inflamed leading edge of demyelinated white matter lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis.},

  abstract = {Lesions obtained early in the course of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been studied immunocytochemically, and compared with the early stages of the experimental lesion induced in rats by the intraspinal injection of lipopolysaccharide. Large hemispheric or double hemispheric sections were examined from patients who had died in the course of acute or early relapsing multiple sclerosis. In MS patients exhibiting hypoxia-like lesions [Pattern III; Lucchinetti et al. Ann Neurol (2000) 47: 707--17], focal areas in the white matter showed mild oedema, microglial activation and mild axonal injury in the absence of overt demyelination. In such lesions T-cell infiltration was mild and restricted to the perivascular space. Myeloperoxidase and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase were expressed primarily by microglia, and the activated form of these cells was associated with extracellular deposition of precipitated fibrin. In addition, these lesions showed up-regulation of proteins involved in tissue preconditioning. When active demyelination started, lesions were associated with massive T-cell infiltration and microglia and macrophages expressed all activation markers studied. Similar tissue alterations were found in rats in the pre-demyelinating stage of lesions induced by the focal injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide into the spinal white matter. We suggest that the areas of microglial activation represent an early stage of tissue injury, which precedes the formation of hypoxia-like demyelinated plaques. The findings indicate that mechanisms associated with innate immunity may play a role in the formation of hypoxia-like demyelinating lesions in MS.},

We discuss recent conceptual and technological advances that allow a better understanding of the transcriptomic and functional heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes (OLs), astrocytes, and microglial cells under inflammatory--demyelinating conditions. Recent single cell transcriptomic studies suggest the occurrence of novel homeostatic and reactive glial subtypes and provide insight into the molecular events during disease progression. Multiplexed RNA in situ hybridization has enabled `mapping back' dysregulated gene expression to glial subtypes within the MS lesion microenvironment. These findings suggest novel homeostatic and reactive glial-cell-type functions both in immune-related processes and neuroprotection relevant to understanding the pathology of MS.},

The fate of developing T cells is specified by the interaction of their antigen receptors with self-peptide--MHC complexes that are displayed by thymic antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Various subsets of thymic APCs are strategically positioned in particular thymic microenvironments and they coordinate the selection of a functional and self-tolerant T cell repertoire. In this Review, we discuss the different strategies that these APCs use to sample and process self antigens and to thereby generate partly unique, 'idiosyncratic' peptide--MHC ligandomes. We discuss how the particular composition of the peptide--MHC ligandomes that are presented by specific APC subsets not only shapes the T cell repertoire in the thymus but may also indelibly imprint the behaviour of mature T cells in the periphery.},

  abstract = {Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is considered the most frequent inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It occurs with a variable prevalence across the world. A rich armamentarium of disease modifying therapies selectively targeting specific actions of the immune system is available for the treatment of MS. Understanding how and where immune cells are primed, how they access the CNS in MS and how immunomodulatory treatments affect neuroinflammation requires a proper knowledge on the mechanisms regulating immune cell trafficking and the special anatomy of the CNS. The brain barriers divide the CNS into different compartments that differ with respect to their accessibility to cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. In steady state, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits immune cell trafficking to activated T cells, which can reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filled compartments to ensure CNS immune surveillance. In MS immune cells breach a second barrier, the glia limitans to reach the CNS parenchyma. Here we will summarize the role of the endothelial, epithelial and glial brain barriers in regulating immune cell entry into the CNS and which immunomodulatory treatments for MS target the brain barriers. Finally, we will explore current knowledge on genetic and environmental factors that may influence immune cell entry into the CNS during neuroinflammation in Africa.},

  abstract = {Getting around the blood--brain barrier                            The meninges comprise three membranes that surround and protect the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have noted the existence of myeloid cells resident there, but little is known about their ontogeny and function, and whether other meningeal immune cell populations have important roles remains unclear (see the Perspective by Nguyen and Kubes). Cugurra               et al.               found in mice that a large proportion of continuously replenished myeloid cells in the dura mater are not blood derived, but rather transit from cranial bone marrow through specialized channels. In models of CNS injury and neuroinflammation, the authors demonstrated that these myeloid cells have an immunoregulatory phenotype compared with their more inflammatory blood-derived counterparts. Similarly, Brioschi               et al.               show that the meninges host B cells that are also derived from skull bone marrow, mature locally, and likely acquire a tolerogenic phenotype. They further found that the brains of aging mice are infiltrated by a second population of age-associated B cells, which come from the periphery and may differentiate into autoantibody-secreting plasma cells after encountering CNS antigens. Together, these two studies may inform future treatment of neurological diseases.

The meningeal compartment hosts both innate and adaptive immune cells, providing constant immunosurveillance of the CNS border regions. Given its strategic location, meningeal immunity is a key component of neuroimmune disorders. Recent studies have investigated the origin and dynamics of meningeal myeloid cells. However, little is known about meningeal B cells.                                         RATIONALE               To investigate the phenotype of meningeal B cells, we used different high-throughput techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq). We further corroborated our finding by flow cytometry and confocal imaging. We determined the origin of meningeal B cells by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and parabiosis experiments. Lastly, we investigated how meningeal B cells change during aging.                                         RESULTS                                We characterized the mouse meninges using                                  scRNA-seq, which revealed that meningeal B cells encompass multiple stages of their development, spanning pro-B to mature B cells. Identical subsets were found in the bone marrow (BM), but not in the blood. CyTOF and flow cytometry further confirmed this result, demonstrating that early B cell subsets that are normally present in the BM are also found in the meninges under homeostasis. BMT with selective reconstitution of the skull BM showed that meningeal B cells are derived from the calvaria; namely, the hematopoietic region located within the cranial flat bones. We then performed parabiosis between wild-type and CD19-Tomato mice, which express the tdTomato fluorescent protein specifically in B cells. This experiment demonstrated that circulating B cells minimally infiltrated the mouse meninges under homeostasis. Using confocal imaging, we showed that B cells migrate from the calvaria to the meninges through specialized vascular channels traversing the inner skull bone. Interactome analysis of our scRNA-seq data highlighted a network of molecular communications between meningeal B cells and dura fibroblast-like cells (FLCs). Notably, we showed that FLCs express high levels of                 Cxcl12                 , whereas dura early B cells express its receptor                 Cxcr4                 . Expression of these molecules in the respective populations was validated by imaging and flow cytometry. The CXCL12--CXCR4 axis is required for the survival and differentiation of early B cells in the BM, and the same mechanism may be present in the dura. We also showed that aged mice ({\textasciitilde}2 years of age) accumulate age-associated B cells (ABCs) and plasma cells in the dura. Compared to na{\"i}ve B cells, ABCs featured important transcriptional changes, as well as reduced diversity of the V-region repertoire and accumulation of somatic mutations, thus indicating antigen experience. Analysis of B cells clones by scBCR-seq showed that dura ABCs infiltrated from the periphery. On the basis of BCR clonality, we also suggest that dura ABCs may locally undergo terminal differentiation into immunoglobulin (Ig)--secreting plasma cells.                                                        CONCLUSION               This study reveals that mouse meninges harbor a lymphopoietic niche specific for the CNS borders. B cell development in the meninges may induce immune tolerance against CNS antigens, thus preserving immune privilege within the CNS. However, blood-derived ABCs accumulate in the meninges over time. Peripheral ABCs are not educated by the CNS antigens and may locally differentiate into CNS-reactive plasma cells. This condition may endanger the immune-privileged CNS environment during aging.                                                   Composition of meningeal B cells in young and aged mice.                   Meningeal B cells originate from the calvaria and migrate to the meninges through skull vascular channels. These B cells complete their development locally, where fibroblast-like cells (FLCs) provide critical factors for survival and differentiation of early B cells (i.e., CXCL12). At this stage, CNS-antigen experience induces immune tolerance. In aged mice, age-associated B cells (ABCs) infiltrate the meninges from the periphery and differentiate into Ig-secreting plasma cells upon encounter with CNS antigens.                                                                         ,              The meninges contain adaptive immune cells that provide immunosurveillance of the central nervous system (CNS). These cells are thought to derive from the systemic circulation. Through single-cell analyses, confocal imaging, bone marrow chimeras, and parabiosis experiments, we show that meningeal B cells derive locally from the calvaria, which harbors a bone marrow niche for hematopoiesis. B cells reach the meninges from the calvaria through specialized vascular connections. This calvarial--meningeal path of B cell development may provide the CNS with a constant supply of B cells educated by CNS antigens. Conversely, we show that a subset of antigen-experienced B cells that populate the meninges in aging mice are blood-borne. These results identify a private source for meningeal B cells, which may help maintain immune privilege within the CNS.},

  abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major health problem, leading to a significant disability and patient suffering. Although chronic activation of the immune system is a hallmark of the disease, its pathogenesis is poorly understood, while current treatments only ameliorate the disease and may produce severe side effects. Methods: Here, we applied a network-based modeling approach based on phosphoproteomic data to uncover the differential activation in signaling wiring between healthy donors, untreated patients, and those under different treatments. Based in the patient-specific networks, we aimed to create a new approach to identify drug combinations that revert signaling to a healthy-like state. We performed ex vivo multiplexed phosphoproteomic assays upon perturbations with multiple drugs and ligands in primary immune cells from 169 subjects (MS patients, n=129 and matched healthy controls, n=40). Patients were either untreated or treated with fingolimod, natalizumab, interferon-{$\beta$}, glatiramer acetate, or the experimental therapy epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). We generated for each donor a dynamic logic model by fitting a bespoke literature-derived network of MS-related pathways to the perturbation data. Last, we developed an approach based on network topology to identify deregulated interactions whose activity could be reverted to a ``healthy-like'' status by combination therapy. The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS was used to validate the prediction of combination therapies.},

Clark               et al.               developed RABID-seq, a method that combines barcoded viral tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (see the Perspective by Silvin and Ginhoux). RABID-seq identified the axon guidance molecules Sema4D-PlexinB2 and EphrinB3-EphB3 as mediators of microglia-astrocyte interactions that promote CNS pathology in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. These studies also identified candidate therapeutic molecules for the modulation of microglia-astrocyte interactions in multiple sclerosis.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eabf1230               ; see also p.               342                        ,              A high-throughput method characterizing cell interactions elucidates microglia-astrocyte communication in the brain.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), including astrocytes and microglia, play critical roles in development, tissue repair, and homeostasis. However, dysregulated astrocyte and microglia responses contribute to the pathogenesis of neurologic diseases. Indeed, environmental chemicals, microbial metabolites, and cell-cell interactions have been shown to modulate disease-promoting responses in astrocytes and microglia in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In particular, although astrocyte interactions with microglia are known to play important roles in the pathology of MS and other neurologic diseases, the pathways that facilitate astrocyte-microglia cross-talk are poorly understood, and consequently, few therapeutic inventions are available to target them.                                         RATIONALE               Understanding the complexity of astrocyte-microglia cross-talk in CNS inflammation requires the study of precise neuroimmune interactions in vivo, but methodologies for defining the specific cell types, pathways, and molecules that mediate these interactions are limited. We developed a virus-based barcoding method for the identification of thousands of CNS cell interactions in vivo and the simultaneous analysis of the transcriptome of interacting cells with single-cell resolution. We applied this technique, named rabies barcode interaction detection followed by sequencing (RABID-seq), to the study of microglia-astrocyte communication in the context of CNS inflammation in EAE and MS.                                         RESULTS                                To develop RABID-seq, we engineered an mRNA-barcoded library in glycoprotein G--deficient pseudorabies virus (Rab{$\Delta$}G-BC), which spreads between interacting cells but can only replicate in cells that transgenically express viral glycoprotein G. We pseudotyped the Rab{$\Delta$}G-BC plasmid library using envelope protein of subgroup A (EnvA) packaging. Thus, the pseudotyped virus only infects cells that transgenically express the EnvA receptor, TVA. After its replication in cells that express TVA and viral glycoprotein G, Rab{$\Delta$}G-BC infects interacting cells, labelling them with the virus-encoded barcode. To study RABID-seq astrocyte interactions in vivo during CNS inflammation in the EAE model of MS, we used transgenic mice expressing glycoprotein G and TVA in astrocytes under the control of the                 Gfap                 promoter. These studies identified several axon guidance molecules as critical mediators of microglia-astrocyte interactions in the context of inflammation. By combining RABID-seq with genetic perturbation studies in vivo, validation with primary mouse and human cells in vitro, and the analysis of MS patient samples by immunostaining and single-cell RNA-seq, we established that microglia-astrocyte interactions mediated by Sema4D-PlexinB1, Sema4D-PlexinB2, and Ephrin-B3--EphB3 promote CNS pathology in EAE---and potentially MS. Notably, Ephrin-B--EphB3 participated in forward and reverse signaling, which boosted both microglia and astrocyte pathogenic activities via the regulation of nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B and mammalian target of rapamycin, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that a CNS-penetrant small-molecule inhibitor of the kinase activity of the EphB3 intracellular domain ameliorates EAE in both acute and chronic progressive models.                                                        CONCLUSION               We developed RABID-seq, a novel approach for the simultaneous investigation of cell interactions and the transcriptome of interacting cells in vivo with single-cell resolution. RABID-seq identified signaling pathways controlled by the axon guidance molecules Sema4D-PlexinB1, Sema4D-PlexinB2, and Ephrin-B3/EphB3 as mediators of microglia-astrocyte interactions that promote CNS pathogenesis and also as candidate targets for therapeutic intervention in neurologic disorders.                                                   Elucidation of microglia-astrocyte interactions by rabies barcode interaction detection followed by sequencing (RABID-seq).                                        Pseudotyped rabies virus expressing barcoded mRNA targets                     Gfap                     +                     astrocytes, where it replicates before infecting neighboring cells, leaving a barcoded trace. Single-cell RNA sequencing reads both cellular mRNAs and viral barcodes, allowing for the reconstruction of in vivo cell interactions and the transcriptional analysis of interacting cells with single-cell resolution.                                                                                            ,              Cell-cell interactions control the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS). To study astrocyte cell interactions in vivo, we developed rabies barcode interaction detection followed by sequencing (RABID-seq), which combines barcoded viral tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using RABID-seq, we identified axon guidance molecules as candidate mediators of microglia-astrocyte interactions that promote CNS pathology in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and, potentially, multiple sclerosis (MS). In vivo cell-specific genetic perturbation EAE studies, in vitro systems, and the analysis of MS scRNA-seq datasets and CNS tissue established that Sema4D and Ephrin-B3 expressed in microglia control astrocyte responses via PlexinB2 and EphB3, respectively. Furthermore, a CNS-penetrant EphB3 inhibitor suppressed astrocyte and microglia proinflammatory responses and ameliorated EAE. In summary, RABID-seq identified microglia-astrocyte interactions and candidate therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Getting around the blood--brain barrier                            The meninges comprise three membranes that surround and protect the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have noted the existence of myeloid cells resident there, but little is known about their ontogeny and function, and whether other meningeal immune cell populations have important roles remains unclear (see the Perspective by Nguyen and Kubes). Cugurra               et al.               found in mice that a large proportion of continuously replenished myeloid cells in the dura mater are not blood derived, but rather transit from cranial bone marrow through specialized channels. In models of CNS injury and neuroinflammation, the authors demonstrated that these myeloid cells have an immunoregulatory phenotype compared with their more inflammatory blood-derived counterparts. Similarly, Brioschi               et al.               show that the meninges host B cells that are also derived from skull bone marrow, mature locally, and likely acquire a tolerogenic phenotype. They further found that the brains of aging mice are infiltrated by a second population of age-associated B cells, which come from the periphery and may differentiate into autoantibody-secreting plasma cells after encountering CNS antigens. Together, these two studies may inform future treatment of neurological diseases.

The diverse role of myeloid populations, including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, in homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS) function is increasingly recognized. Brain borders, including the dura mater of the meninges, host a substantial pool of myeloid cells that mediate immune surveillance of the CNS. During injury and neuroinflammation, myeloid cells infiltrate the CNS and display heterogeneous functions from microglia, the CNS resident macrophages. Understanding myeloid ontogeny in CNS borders and in the CNS parenchyma under homeostasis and during perturbations is critical for our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying immune responses in the diseased CNS and for the design of therapeutic approaches for neurological conditions associated with inflammation, such as injury, chronic neurodegenerative diseases, CNS infections, and brain tumors.                                         RATIONALE               Myeloid cells are critical contributors to CNS function, yet the origins of these cells at CNS borders and the routes of their migration into the CNS parenchyma under inflammatory or neurodegenerative conditions remain unclear. Under certain circumstances---for example, monocyte infiltration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or after CNS injury---myeloid populations are playing protective and pathological roles. We rationalized that these heterogeneous functions may represent diverse cellular origins and sought to investigate the sources of myeloid cell infiltrates and the routes by which they access the injured or inflamed parenchyma. Channels connecting the skull bone marrow to the dura to allow neutrophil migration during stroke were previously described. Thus, we explored whether these channels and the skull bone marrow niche also allow for maintenance of the brain dural myeloid pool under homeostasis and in mouse models of CNS diseases. We further extended our observations to the vertebrae bone marrow niche as a potential source of myeloid cells for the spinal dura.                                         RESULTS               Using the parabiotic pairing of WT--UBC-GFP or CD45.1-CD45.2 mice that share blood circulation, we observed a substantial pool of monocytes and neutrophils in the brain and spinal cord dura that were not blood derived and had not arisen from tissue intrinsic progenitors or local proliferation. Using several approaches, including calvaria bone--flap transplantation and selective irradiation regimens with head or body shielding and bone marrow transfers, we found that these non--blood-derived myeloid cells had originated from skull and vertebrae bone marrow. We reconfirmed the existence of skull bone marrow--dura channels and described the presence of similar channels connecting spinal cord vertebrae bone marrow to spinal dura, allowing an anatomical route for constant myeloid migration from local bone marrow pools. After various CNS injury models, including spinal cord injury, EAE, and optic nerve crush, we showed that CNS-associated bone marrow contributes to parenchymal CNS infiltration. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated potentially nonredundant roles for blood and CNS bone marrow--derived monocytes infiltrating the spinal cord during spinal cord injury and EAE, with blood-derived cells displaying a more inflammatory and possibly pathogenic phenotype.                                         CONCLUSION               Our results show that bone marrow niches adjacent to the brain and spinal cord supply monocytes to the meninges under homeostasis and after CNS injury or neuroinflammatory disease. Moreover, we demonstrate that CNS border--derived myeloid cells can migrate through meningeal barriers into parenchyma under injurious and inflammatory conditions. CNS border--derived myeloid cells exhibit a less inflammatory and more regulatory phenotype when compared with their blood-derived counterparts in models of CNS injury and neuroinflammation. Thus, it is possible that these cells are playing critical roles in the regulation---and possibly attenuation---of immune responses in other contexts, such as CNS infections and brain tumors. Understanding the function of brain border--derived myeloid cells in CNS immune surveillance in physiology and pathology may lead to development of therapeutic avenues to treat neurological diseases.                                                   Myeloid cells from skull and vertebrae bone marrow supply brain borders and the CNS during health and disease.                   Under homeostasis, the dural meninges host a pool of monocytes derived from local bone marrow sources that can differentiate into tissue-resident macrophages. During CNS injury, bone marrow--derived monocytes can infiltrate CNS parenchyma from brain borders.                                                                         ,              The meninges are a membranous structure enveloping the central nervous system (CNS) that host a rich repertoire of immune cells mediating CNS immune surveillance. Here, we report that the mouse meninges contain a pool of monocytes and neutrophils supplied not from the blood but by adjacent skull and vertebral bone marrow. Under pathological conditions, including spinal cord injury and neuroinflammation, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells can originate from brain borders and display transcriptional signatures distinct from their blood-derived counterparts. Thus, CNS borders are populated by myeloid cells from adjacent bone marrow niches, strategically placed to supply innate immune cells under homeostatic and pathological conditions. These findings call for a reinterpretation of immune-cell infiltration into the CNS during injury and autoimmunity and may inform future therapeutic approaches that harness meningeal immune cells.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogenous autoimmune disease in which autoreactive lymphocytes attack the myelin sheath of the central nervous system. B lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS contribute to inflammation and secrete oligoclonal immunoglobulins1,2. Epstein--Barr virus (EBV) infection has been epidemiologically linked to MS, but its pathological role remains unclear3. Here we demonstrate high-affinity molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and the central nervous system protein glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM) and provide structural and in vivo functional evidence for its relevance. A cross-reactive CSF-derived antibody was initially identified by single-cell sequencing of the paired-chain B cell repertoire of MS blood and CSF, followed by protein microarray-based testing of recombinantly expressed CSF-derived antibodies against MS-associated viruses. Sequence analysis, affinity measurements and the crystal structure of the EBNA1--peptide epitope in complex with the autoreactive Fab fragment enabled tracking of the development of the naive EBNA1-restricted antibody to a mature EBNA1--GlialCAM cross-reactive antibody. Molecular mimicry is facilitated by a post-translational modification of GlialCAM. EBNA1 immunization exacerbates disease in a mouse model of MS, and anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies are prevalent in patients with MS. Our results provide a mechanistic link for the association between MS and EBV and could guide the development of new MS therapies. The identification of high-affinity molecular mimicry between the Epstein--Barr virus (EBV) transcription factor EBNA1 and the CNS protein GlialCAM provides a mechanistic link between multiple sclerosis and EBV.},

We tested the hypothesis that MS is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a cohort comprising more than 10 million young adults on active duty in the US military, 955 of whom were diagnosed with MS during their period of service. Risk of MS increased 32-fold after infection with EBV but was not increased after infection with other viruses, including the similarly transmitted cytomegalovirus. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuroaxonal degeneration, increased only after EBV seroconversion.

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), the etiology of which is poorly understood. The most common laboratory abnormality associated with MS is increased intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the major antigenic targets of these antibody responses are unknown. The risk of MS is increased after infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to EBV infection, and MS patients have higher serum titers of anti-EBV antibodies than control populations. Our goal was to identify disease-relevant epitopes of IgG antibodies in MS; to do so, we screened phage-displayed random peptide libraries (12-mer) with total IgG antibodies purified from the brain of a patient with acute MS. We identified and characterized the phage peptides for binding specificity to intrathecal IgG from patients with MS and from controls by ELISA, phage-mediated Immuno-PCR, and isoelectric focusing. We identified two phage peptides that share sequence homologies with EBV nuclear antigens 1 and 2 (EBNA1 and EBNA2), respectively. The specificity of the EBV epitopes found by panning with MS brain IgG was confirmed by ELISA and competitive inhibition assays. Using a highly sensitive phage-mediated immuno-PCR assay, we determined specific bindings of the two EBV epitopes to IgG from CSF from 46 MS and 5 inflammatory control (IC) patients. MS CSF IgG have significantly higher bindings to EBNA1 epitope than to EBNA2 epitope, whereas EBNA1 and EBNA2 did not significantly differ in binding to IC CSF IgG. Further, the EBNA1 epitope was recognized by OCBs from multiple MS CSF as shown in blotting assays with samples separated by isoelectric focusing. The EBNA1 epitope is reactive to MS intrathecal antibodies corresponding to oligoclonal bands. This reinforces the potential role of EBV in the etiology of MS.},

  abstract = {Cytokines are secreted or otherwise released polypeptide factors that exert autocrine and/or paracrine actions, with most cytokines acting in the immune and/or hematopoietic system. They are typically pleiotropic, controlling development, cell growth, survival, and/or differentiation. Correspondingly, cytokines are clinically important, and augmenting or attenuating cytokine signals can have deleterious or therapeutic effects. Besides physiological fine-tuning of cytokine signals, altering the nature or potency of the signal can be important in pathophysiological responses and can also provide novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we give an overview of cytokines, their signaling and actions, and the physiological mechanisms and pharmacologic strategies to fine-tune their actions. In particular, the differential utilization of STAT proteins by a single cytokine or by different cytokines and STAT dimerization versus tetramerization are physiological mechanisms of fine-tuning, whereas anticytokine and anticytokine receptor antibodies and cytokines with altered activities, including cytokine superagonists, partial agonists, and antagonists, represent new ways of fine-tuning cytokine signals.},

  abstract = {The immune system is highly complex and distributed throughout an organism, with hundreds to thousands of cell states existing in parallel with diverse molecular pathways interacting in a highly dynamic and coordinated fashion. Although the characterization of individual genes and molecules is of the utmost importance for understanding immune-system function, high-throughput, high-resolution omics technologies combined with sophisticated computational modeling and machine-learning approaches are creating opportunities to complement standard immunological methods with new insights into immune-system dynamics. Like systems immunology itself, immunology researchers must take advantage of these technologies and form their own diverse networks, connecting with researchers from other disciplines. This Review is an introduction and `how-to guide' for immunologists with no particular experience in the field of omics but with the intention to learn about and apply these systems-level approaches, and for immunologists who want to make the most of interdisciplinary networks. The explosion of single-cell and systems approaches in immunology risks leaving the uninitiated behind.

High-throughput technologies can be used to measure thousands of parameters of the immune system at a genome-wide scale. These system-wide surveys yield massive amounts of quantitative data that provide a means to monitor and probe immune-system function.

A central strategy in human studies is to leverage natural variation to find relationships among variables, including DNA variants, epigenetic states, immune phenotypes, clinical descriptors, and others. Here, we focus on how natural variation is used to find patterns, infer principles, and develop predictive models for two areas: (a) immune cell activation---how single-cell profiling boosts our ability to discover immune cell types and states---and (b) antigen presentation and recognition---how models can be generated to predict presentation of antigens on MHC molecules and their detection by T cell receptors. These are two examples of a shift in how we find the drivers and targets of immunity, especially in the human system in the context of health and disease.},

However, insights come with additional follow-up questions that challenge our perception on how immune responses are generated and fine-tuned to fight a wide array of pathogens in ever-changing and often unpredictable microenvironments. Are immune responses really either being tightly regulated by molecular determinants, or highly flexible attributed to stochasticity? What exactly makes up the basic rules by which single cells cooperate to establish tissue-level immunity? Taking the type I IFN system and its newest insights as a main example throughout this review, we revise the basic concepts of (single) immune cell coordination, redefine the concepts of noise, stochasticity and determinism, and highlight the importance of single-cell variation in immunology and beyond.},

Metabolites and the activity of metabolic pathways drive energy production, macromolecule synthesis, intracellular signalling, post-translational modifications and cell survival. Immunologists who identify a metabolic phenotype in their system are often left wondering where to begin and what does it mean? Here, we provide a framework for navigating and selecting the appropriate biochemical techniques to explore immunometabolism. We offer recommendations for initial approaches to develop and test metabolic hypotheses and how to avoid common mistakes. We then discuss how to take things to the next level with metabolomic approaches, such as isotope tracing and genetic approaches. By proposing strategies and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different methodologies, we aim to provide insight, note important considerations and discuss ways to avoid common misconceptions. Furthermore, we highlight recent studies demonstrating the power of these metabolic approaches to uncover the role of metabolism in immunology. By following the framework in this Review, neophytes and seasoned investigators alike can venture into the emerging realm of cellular metabolism and immunity with confidence and rigour.},

This pause in cancer progression emphasizes the existence of barriers that constrain the growth of disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) at distant sites. Although the nature of these barriers to metastasis might include DTC-intrinsic traits, recent studies have established that the local microenvironment also controls the formation of metastases. In this Perspective, I discuss how site-specific differences of the immune system might be a major selective growth restraint on DTCs, and argue that harnessing tissue immunity will be essential for the next stage in immunotherapy development that reliably prevents the establishment of metastases. A disseminated tumour cell will grow only if it arrives at a `fertile' distant site, which as Ana Lu{\'i}sa Correia posits is determined largely by the immune context at the site. Site-specific differences in local immune cell types, ratios and spatial locations influence whether a disseminated tumour cell establishes metastases or is kept dormant.},

In co-culture, CD66b+ sepsis neutrophils inhibited proliferation and activation of CD4+ T cells. Single-cell multiomic mapping of circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) (29,366 cells, n = 27) indicated altered granulopoiesis in patients with sepsis. These features were enriched in a patient subset with poor outcome and a specific sepsis response signature that displayed higher frequencies of IL1R2+ immature neutrophils, epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures of emergency granulopoiesis in HSPCs and STAT3-mediated gene regulation across different infectious etiologies and syndromes. Our findings offer potential therapeutic targets and opportunities for stratified medicine in severe infection.

To gain insights into the interplay between inter- and intra-cellular mechanisms and deconvolute the complex niche of lesion evolution, we have integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data for different white matter (WM) lesions from patients with PMS combined with spatial transcriptomics of chronic active lesion border. The PMS-specific oligodendrocyte genetic program was governed by the KLF/SP gene family involved in myelination and stress-induced iron uptake. The transferrin gene (TF) and its receptor LRP2 were highly expressed across all lesion types in oligodendrocytes suggesting autocrine communication of iron uptake and were co-localized at the outer border of the chronic active lesion. The genomic accessibility of the structural protein (VIM) and the cystine/glutamate antiporter (SLC7A11) was significantly reduced, and the genes were downregulated in oligodendrocytes. We identified oligodendrocytes expressing the osteopontin gene and complement at the outer edge of the chronic active lesion. We describe a metabolic astrocyte phenotype at the lesion border and an astrocytic-neuronal axis through FGF signaling (FGFR3-FGF13) inside the chronic active lesion. We also identified two distinct B cell co-expression networks with different location and gene expression preferring different lesion types. With single cell multi-omics, we were able to get a snapshot of specific cell types with distinctive molecular signatures and pathways, including their interactions and locations contributing to lesion fate.},

Although much of our understanding of human immunology has derived from studies of peripheral blood, recent work utilizing human tissue resources and innovative computational methods have employed a wholebody, systems-based approach, revealing tremendous complexity and heterogeneity of the immune system within individuals and across the population. In this review, we discuss how tissue localization, developmental and age-associated changes, and conditions of health and disease shape the immune response, as well as how improved understanding of interindividual and tissue-specific immunity can be leveraged for developing targeted therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence has elucidated how multipotent blood progenitors transform their identities in the thymus and undergo commitment to become T cells. Together with environmental signals, a core group of transcription factors have essential roles in this process by directly activating and repressing specific genes. Many of these transcription factors also function in later T cell development, but control different genes. Here, we review how these transcription factors work to change the activities of specific genomic loci during early intrathymic development to establish T cell lineage identity. We introduce the key regulators and highlight newly emergent insights into the rules that govern their actions. Whole-genome deep sequencing-based analysis has revealed unexpectedly rich relationships between inherited epigenetic states, transcription factor--DNA binding affinity thresholds and influences of given transcription factors on the activities of other factors in the same cells. Together, these mechanisms determine T cell identity and make the lineage choice irreversible.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Predicting the binding specificity of T Cell Receptors (TCR) to MHC-peptide complexes (pMHCs) is essential for the development of repertoire-based biomarkers. This affinity may be affected by different components of the TCR, the peptide, and the MHC allele. Historically, the main element used in TCR-peptide binding prediction was the Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDR3) of the beta chain. However, recently the contribution of other components, such as the alpha chain and the other V gene CDRs has been suggested. We use a highly accurate novel deep learning-based TCR-peptide binding predictor to assess the contribution of each component to the binding.                                         Methods               We have previously developed ERGO-I (pEptide tcR matchinG predictiOn), a sequence-based T-cell receptor (TCR)-peptide binding predictor that employs natural language processing (NLP) -based methods. We improved it to create ERGO-II by adding the CDR3 alpha segment, the MHC typing, V and J genes, and T cell type (CD4+ or CD8+) as to the predictor. We then estimate the contribution of each component to the prediction.                                         Results and Discussion                                ERGO-II provides for the first time high accuracy prediction of TCR-peptide for previously unseen peptides. For most tested peptides and all measures of binding prediction accuracy, the main contribution was from the beta chain CDR3 sequence, followed by the beta chain V and J and the alpha chain, in that order. The MHC allele was the least contributing component. ERGO-II is accessible as a webserver at                 http://tcr2.cs.biu.ac.il/                 and as a standalone code at                 https://github.com/IdoSpringer/ERGO-II                 .},

The Analysis Resource is freely available to all researchers and provides access to a variety of epitope analysis and prediction tools. The tools include validated and benchmarked methods to predict MHC class I and class II binding. The predictions from these tools can be combined with tools predicting antigen processing, TCR recognition, and B cell epitope prediction. In addition, the resource contains a variety of secondary analysis tools that allow the researcher to calculate epitope conservation, population coverage, and other relevant analytic variables. The researcher involved in vaccine design and epitope discovery will also be interested in accessing experimental published data, relevant to the specific indication of interest. The database component of the IEDB contains a vast amount of experimentally derived epitope data that can be queried through a flexible user interface.

At the same time, this immune variation is the substrate upon which a plethora of immune-associated diseases develop. Genetic analysis suggests that thousands of individually weak loci together drive up to half of the observed immune variation. Intense selection maintains this genetic diversity, even selecting for the introgressed Neanderthal or Denisovan alleles that have reintroduced variation lost during the out-of-Africa migration. Variations in age, sex, diet, environmental exposure, and microbiome each potentially explain the residual variation, with proof-of-concept studies demonstrating both plausible mechanisms and correlative associations. The confounding interaction of many of these variables currently makes it difficult to assign definitive contributions. Here, we review the current state of play in the field, identify the key unknowns in the causality of immune variation, and identify the multidisciplinary pathways toward an improved understanding.

  abstract = {The ability to study cancer-immune cell communication across the whole tumor section without tissue dissociation is needed, especially for cancer immunotherapy development, which requires understanding of molecular mechanisms and discovery of more druggable targets. In this work, we assembled and evaluated an integrated experimental framework and analytical process to enable genome-wide scale discovery of ligand-receptors potentially used for cellular crosstalks, followed by targeted validation. We assessed the complementarity of four different technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing and Spatial transcriptomic (measuring over \&gt;20,000 genes), RNA               In Situ               Hybridization (RNAscope, measuring 4-12 genes) and Opal Polaris multiplex protein staining (4-9 proteins). To utilize the multimodal data, we implemented existing methods and also developed STRISH (Spatial TRanscriptomic               In Situ               Hybridization), a computational method that can automatically scan across the whole tissue section for local expression of gene (e.g. RNAscope data) and/or protein markers (e.g. Polaris data) to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue. We evaluated the approach to discover and validate cell-cell interaction               in situ               through in-depth analysis of two types of cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which account for over 70\% of cancer cases. We showed that inference of cell-cell interactions using scRNA-seq data can misdetect or detect false positive interactions. Spatial transcriptomics still suffers from misdetecting lowly expressed ligand-receptor interactions, but reduces false discovery. RNAscope and Polaris are sensitive methods for defining the location of potential ligand receptor interactions,  and the  STRISH program can determine the probability that local gene co-expression reflects true cell-cell interaction. We expect that the approach described here will be widely applied to discover and validate ligand receptor interaction in different types of solid cancer tumors.},

Here, we studied pathogen-specific adaptation within the innate immune system, tracking natural killer (NK) cell memory to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Leveraging single-cell multiomic maps of ex vivo NK cells and somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations as endogenous barcodes, we reveal substantial clonal expansion of adaptive NK cells in HCMV               +               individuals. NK cell clonotypes were characterized by a convergent inflammatory memory signature enriched for AP1 motifs superimposed on a private set of clone-specific accessible chromatin regions. NK cell clones were stably maintained in specific epigenetic states over time, revealing that clonal inheritance of chromatin accessibility shapes the epigenetic memory repertoire. Together, we identify clonal expansion and persistence within the human innate immune system, suggesting that these mechanisms have evolved independent of antigen-receptor diversification.},

Here, we established an unbiased blood-innate immunity multiomic and genetic loss-of-function pipeline to define the transcriptome and global phosphoproteome of blood-induced innate immune polarization and its role in microglia neurotoxicity. Blood induced widespread microglial transcriptional changes, including changes involving oxidative stress and neurodegenerative genes. Comparative functional multiomics showed that blood proteins induce distinct receptor-mediated transcriptional programs in microglia and macrophages, such as redox, type I interferon and lymphocyte recruitment. Deletion of the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen largely reversed blood-induced microglia neurodegenerative signatures. Genetic elimination of the fibrinogen-binding motif to CD11b in Alzheimer's disease mice reduced microglial lipid metabolism and neurodegenerative signatures that were shared with autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis mice. Our data provide an interactive resource for investigation of the immunology of blood proteins that could support therapeutic targeting of microglia activation by immune and vascular signals.},

This ability is achieved during thymic development through a complex molecular mechanism based on somatic recombination that leads to the expression of a very heterogeneous population of surface antigen receptors, the T Cell Receptors (TCRs). TCRs are cell specific and represent a sort of ``molecular tag'' of T cells and have been widely studied to monitor the dynamics of T cells in terms of clonality and diversity in several contexts including lymphoid malignancies, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and tumor immunology. In this review, we provide an overview of the strategies used to investigate the TCR repertoire from the pioneering techniques based on the V segments identification to the revolution introduced by Next-Generation Sequencing that allows for high-throughput sequencing of alpha and beta chains. Single cell based approaches brought the analysis to a higher level of complexity and now provide the opportunity to sequence paired alpha and beta chains. We also discuss novel approaches that through the integration of TCR tracking and mRNA single cell sequencing offer a valuable tool to associate antigen specificity to transcriptional dynamics and to understand the molecular mechanisms of T cell plasticity.},

T cells play an important role in antigen recognition by expressing a diverse repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which bind epitopes to mount targeted immune responses. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled the routine generation of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data. Identifying the specific epitopes targeted by different TCRs in these data would be valuable. To accomplish that, we took advantage of the ever-increasing number of TCRs with known epitope specificity curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) since 2004. We compared seven metrics of sequence similarity to determine their power to predict if two TCRs have the same epitope specificity. We found that a comprehensive k-mer matching approach produced the best results, which we have implemented into TCRMatch, an openly accessible tool (http://tools.iedb.org/tcrmatch/) that takes TCR {$\beta$}-chain CDR3 sequences as an input, identifies TCRs with a match in the IEDB, and reports the specificity of each match. We anticipate that this tool will provide new insights into T cell responses captured in receptor repertoire and single cell sequencing experiments and will facilitate the development of new strategies for monitoring and treatment of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer.},

  abstract = {Clonal expansion of lymphocytes is a hallmark of vertebrate adaptive immunity. A small number of precursor cells that recognize a specific antigen proliferate into expanded clones, differentiate and acquire various effector and memory phenotypes, which promote effective immune responses. Recent studies establish a large degree of heterogeneity in the level of expansion and in cell state between and within expanding clones. Studying these processes               in vivo               , while providing insightful information on the level of heterogeneity, is challenging due to the complex microenvironment and the inability to continuously track individual cells over extended periods of time. Live cell imaging of               ex vivo               cultures within micro fabricated arrays provides an attractive methodology for studying clonal expansion. These experiments facilitate continuous acquisition of a large number of parameters on cell number, proliferation, death and differentiation state, with single-cell resolution on thousands of expanding clones that grow within controlled environments. Such data can reveal stochastic and instructive mechanisms that contribute to observed heterogeneity and elucidate the sequential order of differentiation events. Intercellular interactions can also be studied within these arrays by following responses of a controlled number of interacting cells, all trapped within the same microwell. Here we describe implementations of live-cell imaging within microwell arrays for studies of lymphocyte clonal expansion, portray insights already gained from these experiments and outline directions for future research. These tools, together with               in vivo               experiments tracking single-cell responses, will expand our understanding of adaptive immunity and the ways by which it can be manipulated.                        ,              The March 2016 issue contains a Special Feature on Cutting-edge single-cell genomics and modelling in immunology. The recent advent of single-cell genomics has offered unprecedented possibilities for hypothesis-independent characterization of cellular heterogeneity and regulatory states. At the same time, the vast datasets produced by these techniques have highlighted the need for new bioinformatics tools to utilize the contained information to the fullest. In this Special Feature, both the experimental methods for producing such data as well as selected modelling approaches are reviewed, with focus on the applications on the study of the immune system.

To understand this heterogeneity, we combined single-cell RNA-seq, activation reporter and T cell receptor (TCR) analysis to profile thousands of Treg or conventional CD4+FoxP3-- T cells (Tconv) from mouse lymphoid organs and human blood. Treg and Tconv pools showed areas of overlap, as resting `furtive' Tregs with overall similarity to Tconvs or as a convergence of activated states. All Tregs expressed a small core of FoxP3-dependent transcripts, onto which additional programs were added less uniformly. Among suppressive functions, Il2ra and Ctla4 were quasiconstant, inhibitory cytokines being more sparsely distributed. TCR signal intensity did not affect resting/activated Treg proportions but molded activated Treg programs. The main lines of Treg heterogeneity in mice were strikingly conserved in human blood. These results reveal unexpected TCR-shaped states of activation, providing a framework to synthesize previous observations of Treg heterogeneity. Regulatory T (Treg) cells have distinct transcriptional programs underpinning their suppressive functions. Benoist and colleagues use single-cell RNA-seq to describe the transcriptional landscape of Treg cells and the effects of T cell--receptor signaling.},

  abstract = {The vertebrate immune system develops in layers, as modes of immunity have evolved on top of each other through time with the expansion of organismal complexity. The maturation timing of immune cell subsets, such as innate immune cells, innate-like cells and adaptive cells, corresponds to their physiological roles in protective immunity. While various cell subsets have specialized roles, they also complement each other to clear pathogens, resolve inflammation and maintain homeostasis, especially at barrier sites with high microbial density. Immune cells adapt to inflammatory insults through mechanisms including epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, clonal expansion and enhanced communication with the surrounding tissue environment. Over time, these adaptations shape an individual immune identity, reflective of the overlay between the genetic predisposition and the antigenic and environmental exposures of each individual. While some aspects of this immune shaping are natural consequences of immune maturation over time, others are maladaptive and predispose to irreversible pathology. In this Perspective, we provide a framework for categorizing the shaping events of the immune response, in terms of mechanisms, contexts and functional outcomes. We aim to clarify how these terms can be appropriately applied to future findings that impact immune function. Halper-Stromberg and Jabri discuss the molecular and functional adaptations to inflammatory or pathogenic stimuli that shape the immune identity of each individual.},

However, the repertoire of {$\alpha\beta$} T cell receptors (TCRs) is dwarfed by the vast array of potential foreign peptide--MHC complexes, and a comprehensive system requires each T cell to recognize numerous peptides and thus be cross-reactive. This compromise on specificity has profound implications because the chance of any natural peptide--MHC ligand being an optimal fit for its cognate TCR is small, as there will almost always be more-potent agonists. Furthermore, any TCR raised against a specific peptide--MHC complex in vivocan only be the best available solution from the naive T cell pool and is unlikely to be the best possible solution from the substantially greater number of TCRs that could theoretically be produced.

  abstract = {The adaptive immune system stores invaluable information about current and past immune responses and may serve as an ultrasensitive biosensor. Given the immune system's critical role in a wide variety of disease types, this has broad implications for biomedicine. Machine and deep learning is being leveraged to decipher how information is encoded in adaptive immune receptor repertoires to enable prediction from adaptive immune responses and fast-track vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics development. Recent advances include predicting the presence of immunity after vaccination or infection, predicting the presence of disease, and designing antibody-based therapeutics. Outstanding challenges encompass increasing our knowledge of the feature space structure that encodes relevant immune information, addressing the lack of ground truth--labeled data, and improving our handling of genetic and environmental confounding factors.},

  abstract = {Recently developed molecular methods allow large-scale profiling of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences that encode for antigen specificity and immunological memory of these cells. However, it is well-known that the even unperturbed TCR repertoire structure is extremely complex due to the high diversity of TCR rearrangements and multiple biases imprinted by VDJ rearrangement process. The latter gives rise to the phenomenon of ``public'' TCR clonotypes that can be shared across multiple individuals and non-trivial structure of the TCR similarity network. Here, we outline a framework for TCR sequencing data analysis that can control for these biases in order to infer TCRs that are involved in response to antigens of interest. We apply two previously published methods, ALICE and TCRNET, to detect groups of homologous TCRs that are enriched in samples of interest. Using an example dataset of donors with known HLA haplotype and CMV status, we demonstrate that by applying HLA restriction rules and matching against a database of TCRs with known antigen specificity, it is possible to robustly detect motifs of epitope-specific responses in individual repertoires. We also highlight potential shortcomings of TCR clustering methods and demonstrate that highly expanded TCRs should be individually assessed to get the full picture of antigen-specific response.},

We examined the effect of mutations in the antigen-binding site of a Kb-restricted TCR on T cell activation, antigen binding and dissociation from antigen. These parameters were also examined for variants derived from a Kd-restricted peptide that was recognized by a CTL clone. Using these two independent systems, we show that T cell activation can be impaired by mutations that either decrease or increase the binding half-life of the TCR-pMHC interaction. Our data indicate that efficient T cell activation occurs within an optimal dwell-time range of TCR-pMHC interaction. This restricted dwell-time range is consistent with the exclusion of either extremely low or high affinity T cells from the expanded population during immune responses.},

Next-generation sequencing of the T-cell receptors (TCRs) can be used to profile the T-cell repertoire. We developed a customized pipeline for Network Analysis of Immune Repertoire (NAIR) with advanced statistical methods to characterize and investigate changes in the landscape of TCR sequences. We first performed network analysis on the TCR sequence data based on sequence similarity. We then quantified the repertoire network by network properties and correlated it with clinical outcomes of interest. In addition, we identified (1) disease-specific/associated clusters and (2) shared clusters across samples based on our customized search algorithms and assessed their relationship with clinical outcomes such as recovery from COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, to identify disease-specific TCRs, we introduced a new metric that incorporates the clonal generation probability and the clonal abundance by using the Bayes factor to filter out the false positives. TCR-seq data from COVID-19 subjects and healthy donors were used to illustrate that the proposed approach to analyzing the network architecture of the immune repertoire can reveal potential disease-specific TCRs responsible for the immune response to infection.},

Current data sets are limited to a negligible fraction of the universe of possible TCR--ligand pairs, and performance of state-of-the-art predictive models wanes when applied beyond these known binders. In this Perspective article, we make the case for renewed and coordinated interdisciplinary effort to tackle the problem of predicting TCR--antigen specificity.

  abstract = {The T cell repertoire potentially presents complexity compatible, or greater than, that of the human brain. T cell based immune response is involved with practically every part of human physiology, and high-throughput biology needed to follow the T-cell repertoire has made great leaps with the advent of massive parallel sequencing (1). Nevertheless, tools to handle and observe the dynamics of this complexity have only recently started to emerge [e.g., (2--4)] in parallel with sequencing technologies. Here, we present a network-based view of the dynamics of the T cell repertoire, during the course of mammary tumors development in a mouse model. The transition from the T cell receptor as a feature, to network-based clustering, followed by network-based temporal analyses, provides novel insights to the workings of the system and provides novel tools to observe cancer progression via the perspective of the immune system. The crux of the approach here is at the network-motivated clustering. The purpose of the clustering step is not merely data reduction and exposing structures, but rather to detect hubs, or attractors, within the T cell receptor repertoire that might shed light on the behavior of the immune system as a dynamic network. The Clone-Attractor is in fact an extension of the clone concept, i.e., instead of looking at particular clones we observe the extended clonal network by assigning clusters to graph nodes and edges to adjacent clusters (editing distance metric). Viewing the system as dynamical brings to the fore the notion of an attractors landscape, hence the possibility to chart this space and map the sample state at a given time to a vector in this large space. Based on this representation we applied two different methods to demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying changes in the repertoire that correlate with changes in the phenotype: (1) network analysis of the TCR repertoire in which two measures were calculated and demonstrated the ability to differentiate control from transgenic samples, and, (2) machine learning classifier capable of both stratifying control and trangenic samples, as well as to stratify pre-cancer and cancer samples.},

  abstract = {The adaptive immune system generates an incredible diversity of antigen receptors for B and T cells to keep dangerous pathogens at bay. The DNA sequences coding for these receptors arise by a complex recombination process followed by a series of productivity-based filters, as well as affinity maturation for B cells, giving considerable diversity to the circulating pool of receptor sequences. Although these datasets hold considerable promise for medical and public health applications, the complex structure of the resulting adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes analysis difficult. In this paper we introduce sumrep, an R package that efficiently performs a wide variety of repertoire summaries and comparisons, and show how sumrep can be used to perform model validation. We find that summaries vary in their ability to differentiate between datasets, although many are able to distinguish between covariates such as donor, timepoint, and cell type for BCR and TCR repertoires. We show that deletion and insertion lengths resulting from V(D)J recombination tend to be more discriminative characterizations of a repertoire than summaries that describe the amino acid composition of the CDR3 region. We also find that state-of-the-art generative models excel at recapitulating gene usage and recombination statistics in a given experimental repertoire, but struggle to capture many physiochemical properties of real repertoires.},

T cells are inherently flexible and can acquire distinct functions to combat different pathogens or changing circumstances. However, this flexibility can be deleterious or advantageous depending on the disease setting. Here, the authors describe the molecular mechanisms that regulate CD4+T cell plasticity and how it might be harnessed to treat disease. CD4+ T cells differentiate and acquire distinct functions to combat specific pathogens but can also adapt their functions in response to changing circumstances. Although this phenotypic plasticity can be potentially deleterious, driving immune pathology, it also provides important benefits that have led to its evolutionary preservation. Here, we review CD4+ T cell plasticity by examining the molecular mechanisms that regulate it --- from the extracellular cues that initiate and drive cells towards varying phenotypes, to the cytosolic signalling cascades that decipher these cues and transmit them into the cell and to the nucleus, where these signals imprint specific gene expression programmes. By understanding how this functional flexibility is achieved, we may open doors to new therapeutic approaches that harness this property of T cells.},

To determine the states that Teff cells actually adopt in frontline tissues in vivo, we applied single-cell transcriptome and chromatin analyses to colonic Teff cells in germ-free or conventional mice or in mice after challenge with a range of phenotypically biasing microbes. Unexpected subsets were marked by the expression of the interferon (IFN) signature or myeloid-specific transcripts, but transcriptome or chromatin structure could not resolve discrete clusters fitting classic helper T cell (TH) subsets. At baseline or at different times of infection, transcripts encoding cytokines or proteins commonly used as TH markers were distributed in a polarized continuum, which was functionally validated. Clones derived from single progenitors gave rise to both IFN-{$\gamma$}- and interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells. Most of the transcriptional variance was tied to the infecting agent, independent of the cytokines produced, and chromatin variance primarily reflected activities of activator protein (AP)-1 and IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factor (TF) families, not the canonical subset master regulators T-bet, GATA3 or ROR{$\gamma$}. Helper T cell subsets are characterized functionally by the cytokines they produce. Benoist and colleagues demonstrate that in vivo helper T cells do not manifest as discrete helper subsets but rather form a continuum shaped by microbial exposure.},

IL-7R signalling activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), and this seems to promote the expression of the transcription factor early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) and cyclin D3, which are required for the specification and proliferation, respectively, of B cell lineage progenitors. The IL-7R also activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which ensures cell survival.IL-7R signalling represses Ig{$\kappa$} locus recombination. Activation of PI3K promotes degradation of forkhead box protein O (FOXO) transcription factors, which are necessary for inducing the recombination-activating genes (RAGs).

Developing B cells that have successfully expressed a pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) undergo clonal expansion, but must exit the cell cycle before rearranging their immunoglobulin light chain loci. The authors discuss how signalling through the interleukin-7 receptor and BCR is coordinated in a mutually exclusive manner to ensure the production of mature B cells without risking leukaemic transformation. The development of B cells is dependent on the sequential DNA rearrangement of immunoglobulin loci that encode subunits of the B cell receptor. The pathway navigates a crucial checkpoint that ensures expression of a signalling-competent immunoglobulin heavy chain before commitment to rearrangement and expression of an immunoglobulin light chain. The checkpoint segregates proliferation of pre-B cells from immunoglobulin light chain recombination and their differentiation into B cells. Recent advances have revealed the molecular circuitry that controls two rival signalling systems, namely the interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor and the pre-B cell receptor, to ensure that proliferation and immunoglobulin recombination are mutually exclusive, thereby maintaining genomic integrity during B cell development.},

B-1 cells are well described in mice, but not in humans. However, humans do generate natural polyreactive antibodies, and candidate functional human homologues of mouse B-1 cells are beginning to emerge. In this Review, Nicole Baumgarth describes the development and functions of B-1 cells. These innate-like B cells serve as the major source of natural antibody in mice, and can have important roles in defence against mucosal pathogens and in maintaining tissue homeostasis. During their development, B and T cells with self-reactive antigen receptors are generally deleted from the repertoire to avoid autoimmune diseases. Paradoxically, innate-like B-1 cells in mice are positively selected for self-reactivity and form a pool of long-lived, self-renewing B cells that produce most of the circulating natural IgM antibodies. This Review provides an overview of the developmental processes that shape the B-1 cell pool in mice, outlines the functions of B-1 cells in both the steady state and during host defence, and discusses possible functional B-1 cell homologues that exist in humans.},

Host adaptation at these sites is an active process that involves interaction between immune cells and tissue cells. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a pivotal role in enforcing homeostasis at barrier surfaces, illustrated by the development of intestinal and skin inflammation in diseases caused by primary deficiency in Treg cells. Treg cells at barrier sites are phenotypically distinct from their lymphoid-organ counterparts, and these `tissue' signatures often reflect their tissue-adapted function. We discuss current understanding of Treg cell adaptation in the intestine and skin, including unique phenotypes, functions and metabolic demands, and how increased knowledge of Treg cells at barrier sites might guide precision medicine therapies. The skin and intestine are unique environments at the front line of the immune system.

We applied high-resolution mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to characterize 28 primary human hematopoietic cell populations in steady and activated states at a depth of {\textquestiondown}10,000 proteins in total.

Not only does the thymic environment support the rearrangement and expression of diverse T cell receptors but also provides a unique niche for the selection of appropriate T cell clones. Thymic selection ensures that the repertoire of available T cells is both useful (being MHC-restricted) and safe (being self-tolerant). The unique antigen-presentation features of the thymus ensure that the display of self-antigens is optimal to induce tolerance to all types of self-tissue. MHC class-specific functions of CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ killer T cells and CD4+ regulatory T cells are also established in the thymus. Finally, the thymus provides signals for the development of several minor T cell subsets that promote immune and tissue homeostasis. This Review provides an introductory-level overview of our current understanding of the sophisticated thymic selection mechanisms that ensure T cells are useful and safe. This Review summarizes how the processes of thymic selection together ensure that the T cell repertoire is fully functional and safe. In the thymus, T cell receptor signal strength is integrated with distinct stromal cues to result in positive or negative selection of thymocytes or the generation of regulatory cells.},

  abstract = {Myeloid cells are a major cellular compartment of the immune system comprising monocytes, dendritic cells, tissue macrophages, and granulocytes. Models of cellular ontogeny, activation, differentiation, and tissue-specific functions of myeloid cells have been revisited during the last years with surprising results; for example, most tissue macrophages are yolk sac derived, monocytes and macrophages follow a multidimensional model of activation, and tissue signals have a significant impact on the functionality of all these cells. While these exciting results have brought these cells back to center stage, their enormous plasticity and heterogeneity, during both homeostasis and disease, are far from understood. At the same time, the ongoing revolution in single-cell genomics, with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) leading the way, promises to change this. Prevailing models of hematopoiesis with distinct intermediates are challenged by scRNA-seq data suggesting more continuous developmental trajectories in the myeloid cell compartment. Cell subset structures previously defined by protein marker expression need to be revised based on unbiased analyses of scRNA-seq data. Particularly in inflammatory conditions, myeloid cells exhibit substantially vaster heterogeneity than previously anticipated, and work performed within large international projects, such as the Human Cell Atlas, has already revealed novel tissue macrophage subsets. Based on these exciting developments, we propose the next steps to a full understanding of the myeloid cell compartment in health and diseases.},

  abstract = {Most mathematical models that describe the individual or collective actions of cells aim at creating faithful representations of limited sets of data in a self-consistent manner. Consistency with relevant physiological rules pertaining to the greater picture is rarely imposed. By themselves, such models have limited predictive or even explanatory value, contrary to standard claims. Here I try to show that a more critical examination of currently held paradigms is necessary and could potentially lead to models that pass the test of time. In considering the evolution of paradigms over the past decades I focus on the ``smart surveillance'' theory of how T cells can respond differentially, individually and collectively, to both self- and foreign antigens depending on various ``contextual'' parameters. The overall perspective is that physiological messages to cells are encoded not only in the biochemical connections of signaling molecules to the cellular machinery but also in the magnitude, kinetics, and in the time- and space-contingencies, of sets of stimuli. By rationalizing the feasibility of subthreshold interactions, the ``dynamic tuning hypothesis,'' a central component of the theory, set the ground for further theoretical and experimental explorations of dynamically regulated immune tolerance, homeostasis and diversity, and of the notion that lymphocytes participate in nonclassical physiological functions. Some of these efforts are reviewed. Another focus of this review is the concomitant regulation of immune activation and homeostasis through the operation of a feedback mechanism controlling the balance between renewal and differentiation of activated cells. Different perspectives on the nature and regulation of chronic immune activation in HIV infection have led to conflicting models of HIV pathogenesis---a major area of research for theoretical immunologists over almost three decades---and can have profound impact on ongoing HIV cure strategies. Altogether, this critical review is intended to constructively influence the outlook of prospective model builders and of interested immunologists on the state of the art and to encourage conceptual work.},

  abstract = {The cells of the immune system respond to a great variety of different signals that frequently reach them simultaneously. Computational models of signaling pathways and cellular behavior can help us explore the biochemical mechanisms at play during such responses, in particular when those models aim at incorporating molecular details of intracellular reaction networks. Such detailed models can encompass hypotheses about the interactions among molecular binding domains and how these interactions are modulated by, for instance, post-translational modifications, or steric constraints in multi-molecular complexes. In this way, the models become formal representations of mechanistic immunological hypotheses that can be tested through quantitative simulations. Due to the large number of parameters (molecular abundances, association-, dissociation-, and enzymatic transformation rates) the goal of simulating the models can, however, in many cases no longer be the fitting of particular parameter values. Rather, the simulations perform sweeps through parameter space to test whether a model can account for certain experimentally observed features when allowing the parameter values to vary within experimentally determined or physiologically reasonable ranges. We illustrate how this approach can be used to explore possible mechanisms of immunological pathway crosstalk. Probing the input-output behavior of mechanistic pathway models through systematic simulated variations of receptor stimuli will soon allow us to derive cell population behavior from single-cell models, thereby bridging a scale gap that currently still is frequently addressed through heuristic phenomenological multi-scale models.},

We outline ongoing challenges facing the integration of mechanistic modelling with experimental and clinical immunology, and suggest how these may be overcome.

  abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with the unique ability to mediate inflammatory responses of the immune system. Given the critical role of DCs in shaping immunity, they present an attractive avenue as a therapeutic target to program the immune system and reverse immune disease disorders. To ensure appropriate immune response, DCs utilize intricate and complex molecular and cellular interactions that converge into a seamless phenotype. Computational models open novel frontiers in research by integrating large-scale interaction to interrogate the influence of complex biological behavior across scales. The ability to model large biological networks will likely pave the way to understanding any complex system in more approachable ways. We developed a logical and predictive model of DC function that integrates the heterogeneity of DCs population, APC function, and cell-cell interaction, spanning molecular to population levels. Our logical model consists of 281 components that connect environmental stimuli with various layers of the cell compartments, including the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus to represent the dynamic processes within and outside the DC, such as signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions. We also provided three sample use cases to apply the model in the context of studying cell dynamics and disease environments. First, we characterized the DC response to Sars-CoV-2 and influenza co-infection by               in-silico               experiments and analyzed the activity level of 107 molecules that play a role in this co-infection. The second example presents simulations to predict the crosstalk between DCs and T cells in a cancer microenvironment. Finally, for the third example, we used the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis against the model's components to identify 45 diseases and 24 molecular pathways that the DC model can address. This study presents a resource to decode the complex dynamics underlying DC-derived APC communication and provides a platform for researchers to perform               in-silico               experiments on human DC for vaccine design, drug discovery, and immunotherapies.},

  abstract = {Myeloid cells are a significant proportion of leukocytes within tissues, comprising granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. With the identification of various myeloid cells that perform separate but complementary functions during homeostasis and disease, our understanding of tissue myeloid cells has evolved significantly. Exciting findings from transcriptomics profiling and fate-mapping mouse models have facilitated the identification of their developmental origins, maturation, and tissue-specific specializations. This review highlights the current understanding of tissue myeloid cells and the contributing factors of functional heterogeneity to better comprehend the complex and dynamic immune interactions within the healthy or inflamed tissue. Specifically, we discuss the new understanding of the contributions of granulocyte-monocyte progenitor--derived phagocytes to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity as well as the impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. Lastly, we explore the developing paradigm of myeloid cell heterogeneity during inflammation and disease.},

Here, we profiled {\textquestiondown}25,000 differentiating and mature mouse neutrophils using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape of neutrophil maturation, function and fate decision in their steady state and during bacterial infection. Eight neutrophil populations were defined by distinct molecular signatures. The three mature peripheral blood neutrophil subsets arise from distinct maturing bone marrow neutrophil subsets. Driven by both known and uncharacterized transcription factors, neutrophils gradually acquire microbicidal capability as they traverse the transcriptional landscape, representing an evolved mechanism for fine-tuned regulation of an effective but balanced neutrophil response. Bacterial infection reprograms the genetic architecture of neutrophil populations, alters dynamic transitions between subpopulations and primes neutrophils for augmented functionality without affecting overall heterogeneity. In summary, these data establish a reference model and general framework for studying neutrophil-related disease mechanisms, biomarkers and therapeutic targets at single-cell resolution. Luo and colleagues use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape of neutrophil maturation, function and fate decision in their steady state and during bacterial infection.},

We performed a comprehensive immunophenotypic and transcriptome analysis, at a bulk and single-cell level, of neutrophils from healthy donors and patients undergoing stress myelopoiesis upon exposure to growth factors, transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC-T), development of pancreatic cancer and viral infection. We uncover an extreme diversity of human neutrophils in vivo, reflecting the rates of cell mobilization, differentiation and exposure to environmental signals. Integrated control of developmental and inducible transcriptional programs linked flexible granulopoietic outputs with elicitation of stimulus-specific functional responses. In this context, we detected an acute interferon (IFN) response in the blood of patients receiving HSC-T that was mirrored by marked upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes in neutrophils but not in monocytes. Systematic characterization of human neutrophil plasticity may uncover clinically relevant biomarkers and support the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Recent studies suggest that neutrophils can exhibit substantial function diversity. Here, Ostuni and colleagues perform immunophenotyping and transcriptome analysis to characterize the heterogeneity of human neutrophils, both under steady state and upon stress-induced conditions.},

We propose the term conditioned immunity to describe the multifaceted mechanisms by which the microbiome modulates immunity. In this regard, microbial colonization is a conditioning exposure that has durable effects on immune function through the action of secondary metabolites, foreign molecular patterns, and antigens. Here, we discuss how spatial niches impact host exposure to microbial products at the level of dose and timing, which elicit diverse conditioned responses.},

Classical models were based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), difference equations, and cellular automata. These models focused on the `simple' dynamics obtained between a small number of reagent types (e.g. one type of receptor and one type of antigen or two T-cell populations). With the advent of high-throughput methods, genomic data, and unlimited computing power, immunological modeling shifted toward the informatics side. Many current applications of mathematical models in immunology are now focused around the concepts of high-throughput measurements and system immunology (immunomics), as well as the bioinformatics analysis of molecular immunology. The types of models have shifted from mainly ODEs of simple systems to the extensive use of Monte Carlo simulations. The transition to a more molecular and more computer-based attitude is similar to the one occurring over all the fields of complex systems analysis. An interesting additional aspect in theoretical immunology is the transition from an extreme focus on the adaptive immune system (that was considered more interesting from a theoretical point of view) to a more balanced focus taking into account the innate immune system also. We here review the origin and evolution of mathematical modeling in immunology and the contribution of such models to many important immunological concepts.},

Recent work has both validated a crucial prediction of this T cell diversification model and refined the model.

  abstract = {The ability of T cells to undergo robust cell division in response to antigenic stimulation is essential for competent T cell function. However, this ability is reduced with aging and contributes to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, cancers, and other diseases among older adults. To better understand T cell aging, improved measurements of age-related cellular changes in T cells are necessary. The recent development of machine learning (ML)-assisted transcriptome-based quantification of individual CD8+ T cell age represents a significant step forward in this regard. It reveals both prominent and subtle changes in gene expression and points to potential functional alterations of CD8+ T cells with aging. I argue that single-cell transcriptome-based age prediction in the immune system may have promising future applications.},

With the influx of large-scale data sets from diverse modalities, the resolution achieved has supported the long-held notion that immune cells are naturally organized into hierarchical relationships, characterized at multiple levels. Such a multigranular structure corresponds to key geometric and topological features. Given that differences between an effective and ineffective immunological response may not be found at one level, there is vested interest in characterizing and predicting outcomes from such features. In this review, we highlight single cell methods and principles for learning geometric and topological properties of data at multiple scales, discussing their contributions to immunology.

In this role, they have both effector functions for neutralizing pathogens and sentinel functions for alerting other immune cells of diverse pathologic threats, thereby initiating and coordinating a multipronged immune response. Macrophages are distributed throughout the body---they circulate in the blood, line the mucosal membranes, reside within organs, and survey the connective tissue. Several reviews have summarized their diverse roles in different physiological scenarios and in the initiation or amplification of different pathologies. In this review, we propose that both the effector and the sentinel functions of healthy macrophages rely on three hallmark properties: response specificity, context dependence, and stimulus memory. When these hallmark properties are diminished, the macrophage's biological functions are impaired, which in turn results in increased risk for immune dysregulation, manifested by immune deficiency or autoimmunity.

Hoffmann and colleagues show that RelB-p50 complexes, regulated by I{$\kappa$}B, exist in dendritic cells and contribute to inflammatory gene expression via canonical NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway activation. The NF-{$\kappa$}B protein RelB controls dendritic cell (DC) maturation and may be targeted therapeutically to manipulate T cell responses in disease. Here we report that RelB promoted DC activation not as the expected RelB-p52 effector of the noncanonical NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway, but as a RelB-p50 dimer regulated by canonical I{$\kappa$}Bs, I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} and I{$\kappa$}B{$\varepsilon$}. I{$\kappa$}B control of RelB minimized spontaneous maturation but enabled rapid pathogen-responsive maturation. Computational modeling of the NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling module identified control points of this unexpected cell type--specific regulation. Fibroblasts that we engineered accordingly showed DC-like RelB control. Canonical pathway control of RelB regulated pathogen-responsive gene expression programs. This work illustrates the potential utility of systems analyses in guiding the development of combination therapeutics for modulating DC-dependent T cell responses.},

  abstract = {Immunology through a human lens             The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the critical need to better understand the human immune system and how to unleash its power to develop vaccines and therapeutics. Much of our knowledge of the immune system has accrued from studies in mice, yet vaccines and drugs that work effectively in mice do not always translate into humans. Pulendran and Davis review recent technological advances that have facilitated the study of the immune system in humans. They discuss new insights and how these can affect the development of drugs and vaccines in the modern era.                            Science               , this issue p.               eaay4014                        ,                             BACKGROUND               The mammalian immune system is a remarkable sensory system for the detection and neutralization of pathogens. History is replete with the devastating effects of plagues, and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a defining global health crisis of our time. Although the development of effective vaccines has saved many lives, the basic workings of the immune system are complex and require the development of animal models, such as inbred mice. Indeed, research in mice has been enormously productive, and the tremendous insights gleaned have resulted in many Nobel prizes and other accolades. However, past results are not necessarily a reliable guide to the future, and a notable limitation of animal models has been their failure to accurately model some human diseases and their inability to predict human immune responses in many cases. With regard to inbred mice, which have been the principal model of choice for immunology, this is likely due to the compromises that were necessary to create a more tractable and reproducible system for experimentation, such as genetic uniformity and lack of pathogen exposure, as well as the fact that mice are evolutionarily quite distinct. These considerations suggest that direct studies of the human immune system are likely to be extremely rewarding, both from a scientific and a medical perspective.                                         ADVANCES               In the past decade there has been an explosion of new approaches and technologies to explore the human immune system with unprecedented precision. Insights into the human immune response to vaccination, cancers, and viral infections such as COVID-19 have come from high-throughput ``omics'' technologies that measure the behavior of genes, mRNA (single-cell transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), cells (mass cytometry), and epigenetic modifications (ATAC-seq), coupled with computational approaches.                                         OUTLOOK               Sydney Brenner remarked in 2008, ``We don't have to look for a model organism anymore. Because we are the model organisms.'' We propose that studying the immune system in humans, who are genetically diverse and afflicted by a multitude of diseases, offers both a direct link to medicine (i.e., ``translation'') and the very real prospect of discovering fundamentally new human biology. New approaches and technology are now making this area much more approachable, but profiling immunity in humans is but the first step. Computational mining of the data and biological validation in animal models or human organoids are essential next steps, in an iterative cycle that seeks to bridge fundamental and applied science, as well as mouse and human immunology, in a seamless continuum of scientific discovery and translational medicine. This will represent a new paradigm for accelerating the development of vaccines and therapeutics.                                                   Probing the human immune response to viral infections.                   Systems biology techniques can be used to probe the human immune response to viral infections and can define molecular signatures that predict disease severity and illuminate the underlying mechanisms of disease.

More recently, new strategies and technologies have been developed to directly explore the human immune system with unprecedented precision. We discuss how these approaches are advancing our mechanistic understanding of human immunology and are facilitating the development of vaccines and therapeutics for infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.},

To investigate the role of SREBP signaling in modulating immune responses, we generated mice with B cell- or CD11c+ antigen-presenting cell (APC)-specific deletion of SCAP, an essential regulator of SREBP signaling. Ablation of SCAP in CD11c+ APCs had no effect on immune responses. In contrast, SREBP signaling in B cells was critical for antibody responses, as well as the generation of germinal centers,memory B cells and bone marrow plasma cells. SREBP signaling was required for metabolic reprogramming in activated B cells. Upon mitogen stimulation, SCAP-deficient B cells could not proliferate and had decreased lipid rafts. Deletion of SCAP in germinal center B cells using AID-Cre decreased lipid raft content and cell cycle progression. These studies provide mechanistic insights coupling sterol metabolism with the quality and longevity of humoral immunity. The regulatory protein SREBP is required for CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming after activation. Luo et al. demonstrate that stimulated B cells require SCAP, a regulator of SREBP, for metabolic reprogramming and the formation and maintenance of germinal center B cells.},

Here we have used a systems biology approach to study innate and adaptive responses to vaccination against influenza in humans during three consecutive influenza seasons. We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.},

  abstract = {To meet the increasing demand for data sharing, data reuse and meta-analysis in the immunology research community, we have developed the data discovery system ImmuneData. The system provides integrated access to five immunology data repositories funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation, including ImmPort, ImmuneSpace, ITN TrialShare, ImmGen and IEDB. ImmuneData restructures the data repositories' metadata into a uniform schema using domain experts' knowledge and state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. It comes with a user-friendly web interface, accessible at http://www.immunedata.org/, and a Google-like search engine for biological researchers to find and access data easily. The vast quantity of synonyms used in biomedical research increase the likelihood of incomplete search results. Thus, our search engine converts queries submitted by users into ontology terms, which are then expended by NLP technologies to ensure that the search results will include all synonyms for a particular concept. The system also includes an advanced search function to build customized queries to meet higher-level users' needs. ImmuneData ensures the FAIR principle (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) of the five data repositories to benefit data reuse in the immunology research community. The data pipeline constructing our system can be extended to other data repositories to build a more comprehensive biological data discovery system.},

  abstract = {Immunological studies frequently analyze individual components (e.g., signaling pathways) of immune systems in a reductionist manner. In contrast, systems immunology aims to give a synthetic understanding of how these components function together as a whole. While immunological research involves in vivo and in vitro experiments, systems immunology research can also be conducted in silico. With an increasing interest in systems-level studies spawned by high-throughput technologies, many immunologists are looking forward to insights provided by computational modeling and simulation. However, modeling and simulation research has mainly been conducted in computational fields, and therefore, little material is available or accessible to immunologists today. This survey is an attempt at bridging the gap between immunologists and systems immunology modeling and simulation. Modeling and simulation refer to building and executing an in silico replica of an immune system. Models are specified within a mathematical or algorithmic framework called formalism and then implemented using software tools. A plethora of modeling formalisms and software tools are reported in the literature for systems immunology. However, it is difficult for a new entrant to the field to know which of these would be suitable for modeling an immunological application at hand. This paper covers three aspects. First, it introduces the field of system immunology emphasizing on the modeling and simulation components. Second, it gives an overview of the principal modeling formalisms, each of which is illustrated with salient applications in immunological research. This overview of formalisms and applications is conducted not only to illustrate their power but also to serve as a reference to assist immunologists in choosing the best formalism for the problem at hand. Third, it lists major software tools, which can be used to practically implement models in these formalisms. Combined, these aspects can help immunologists to start experimenting with in silico models. Finally, future research directions are discussed. Particularly, we identify integrative frameworks to facilitate the coupling of different modeling formalisms and modeling the adaptation properties through evolution of immune systems as the next key research efforts necessary to further develop the multidisciplinary field of systems immunology.},

How T cells achieve this is now beginning to be understood. We underscore temporal integration of digital T cell receptor (TCR) signaling as the basis for achieving scaled response by means of accumulating crucial mediators over time. We also discuss the role of temporally integrated crosstalk between TCR and IL2 signaling in mediating a scaled, coherent, collective response by T cells. Finally, we highlight numerous known and putative regulatory interactions in the transcriptional program that are expected to quantitatively scale the T cell response, and also offer new mechanisms to hitherto unexplained observations.},

These works have repeatedly shown vaccine response to be an orchestrated process involving multiple arms of immunity most noticeable sensing and innate components. Prediction of vaccine responses based on system-wide measures is achievable, but challenges remain for robust population wide predictions based only on pre-vaccination measures, especially in partially efficacious vaccines such as influenza. This is especially true in older adults, who are often less responsive to vaccination and exhibit high level of variation compared to young in many components of immunity. Despite this increase in variation, most of the studies on aging use group averages of immune phenotypes to model immune system behavior. Using systems approaches, it is possible to exploit this variation to form distinguishable clusters of phenotypes within and across individuals to discover underlying immune states.},

Systems immunology combines traditional immunology with modern `omic profiling techniques and computational modeling to promote rapid and transformative advances in vaccinology and vaccine discovery. The NIH/NIAID Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) has leveraged systems immunology approaches to identify molecular signatures associated with the immunogenicity of many vaccines. However, comparative analyses have been limited by the distributed nature of some data, potential batch effects across studies, and the absence of multiple relevant studies from non-HIPC groups in               ImmPort               . To support comparative analyses across different vaccines, we have created the Immune Signatures Data Resource, a compendium of standardized systems vaccinology datasets. This data resource is available through               ImmuneSpace               , along with code to reproduce the processing and batch normalization starting from the underlying study data in               ImmPort               and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The current release comprises 1405 participants from 53 cohorts profiling the response to 24 different vaccines.

Recognition of self-peptide major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) determines the CD8               +               or CD4               +               T cell lineage choice, respectively, but how distinct TCR signals drive transcriptional programs of lineage commitment remains largely unknown.

These analyses identified a sequential process whereby all thymocytes initiate CD4               +               T cell lineage differentiation during a first wave of TCR signaling, followed by a second TCR signaling wave that coincides with CD8               +               T cell lineage specification.

To address these, we analyzed the single-cell transcriptome and TCR repertoire of blood and liver MAIT cells and developed functional RNA-sequencing, a method to integrate function and TCR clonotype at single-cell resolution. MAIT cell clonal diversity was comparable to conventional memory T cells, with private TCR repertoires shared across matched tissues. Baseline functional diversity was low and largely related to tissue site. MAIT cells showed stimulus-specific transcriptional responses in vitro, with cells positioned along gradients of activation. Clonal identity influenced resting and activated transcriptional profiles but intriguingly was not associated with the capacity to produce IL-17. Overall, MAIT cells show phenotypic and functional diversity according to tissue localization, stimulation environment and clonotype.},

In the present study, the diversity of gene expression and genome accessibility by mouse CD8+ TRM cells from distinct organs that responded to viral infection revealed both shared and tissue-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures. TRM cells in the intestine and salivary glands expressed transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$}-induced genes and were maintained by ongoing TGF-{$\beta$} signaling, whereas those in the fat, kidney and liver were not. Constructing transcriptional--regulatory networks identified the transcriptional repressor Hic1 as a critical regulator of TRM cell differentiation in the small intestine and showed that Hic1 overexpression enhanced TRM cell differentiation and protection from infection. Provision of a framework for understanding how CD8+ TRM cells adapt to distinct tissue environments, and identification of tissue-specific transcriptional regulators mediating these adaptations, inform strategies to boost protective memory responses at sites most vulnerable to infection. Goldrath and colleagues define the diversity of gene expression and genome accessibility in mouse CD8+ TRM cells in distinct tissues and identify molecules critical forgeneration of CD8+ TRM cells in response to acute viral infection.},

Within an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, DC antitumor functions can, however, be severely impaired. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of DC capture and activation by tumor cell antigens and the role of the tumor microenvironment in shaping DC functions, taking advantage of recent studies showing the phenotype acquisition, transcriptional state and functional programs revealed by scRNA-seq analysis. The therapeutic potential of DC-mediated tumor antigen sensing in priming antitumor immunity is also discussed.},

Here, we obtained blood and tissues from human organ donors to examine T cells across major barrier sites (skin, lung, jejunum), associated lymph nodes, lymphoid organs (spleen, bone marrow), and in circulation. By integrating single-cell protein and transcriptome profiling, we demonstrate that human barrier sites contain tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells that exhibit site-adapted profiles for residency, homing and function distinct from circulating memory T cells. Incorporating T cell receptor and transcriptome analysis, we show that circulating memory T cells are highly expanded, display extensive overlap between sites and exhibit effector and cytolytic functional profiles, while TRM clones exhibit site-specific expansions and distinct functional capacities. Together, our findings indicate that circulating T cells are more disseminated and differentiated, while TRM cells exhibit tissue-specific adaptation and clonal segregation, suggesting that strategies to promote barrier immunity require tissue targeting. Farber and colleagues examine the phenotypic, transcriptomic, clonal, and functional differences between tissue-resident T cells in various barrier tissue sites relative to T cells in lymphoid organs and circulation in humans.},

  abstract = {Selective differentiation of CD4+ T helper (Th) cells into specialized subsets such as Th1 and Th2 cells is a key element of the adaptive immune system driving appropriate immune responses. Besides those canonical Th-cell lineages, hybrid phenotypes such as Th1/2 cells arise               in vivo               , and their generation could be reproduced               in vitro               . While master-regulator transcription factors like T-bet for Th1 and GATA-3 for Th2 cells drive and maintain differentiation into the canonical lineages, the transcriptional architecture of hybrid phenotypes is less well understood. In particular, it has remained unclear whether a hybrid phenotype implies a mixture of the effects of several canonical lineages for each gene, or rather a bimodal behavior across genes. Th-cell differentiation is a dynamic process in which the regulatory factors are modulated over time, but longitudinal studies of Th-cell differentiation are sparse. Here, we present a dynamic transcriptome analysis following Th-cell differentiation into Th1, Th2, and Th1/2 hybrid cells at 3-h time intervals in the first hours after stimulation. We identified an early bifurcation point in gene expression programs, and we found that only a minority of {\textasciitilde}20\% of Th cell-specific genes showed mixed effects from both Th1 and Th2 cells on Th1/2 hybrid cells. While most genes followed either Th1- or Th2-cell gene expression, another fraction of {\textasciitilde}20\% of genes followed a Th1 and Th2 cell-independent transcriptional program associated with the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT4. Overall, our results emphasize the key role of high-resolution longitudinal data for the characterization of cellular phenotypes.},

V(D)J recombination efficiently generate a virtually limitless diversity through random recombination of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes with diverse non-templated junctions between the selected gene segments. Following antigen stimulation, affinity maturation by SHM produces antibodies with refined specificity mediated by mutations typically focused in complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which form the bulk of the antigen recognition site. While V(D)J recombination and SHM are responsible for much of the diversity of the antibody repertoire, there are several secondary mechanisms that, while less frequent, make substantial contributions to antibody diversity including V(DD)J recombination (or D--D fusion), SHM-associated insertions and deletions, and affinity maturation and antigen contact by non-CDR regions of the antibody. In addition to enhanced diversity, these mechanisms allow the production of antibodies that are critical to response to a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens but that would be difficult to generate using only the primary mechanisms of diversification.},

  abstract = {To perform their specific functional role, B and T lymphocytes, cells of the adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates, need to express one (and, preferably, only one) form of antigen receptor, i.e. the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor (TCR), respectively. This end goal depends initially on a series of DNA cis-rearrangement events between randomly chosen units from separate clusters of V, D (at some immunoglobulin and TCR loci) and J gene segments, a biomolecular process collectively referred to as V(D)J recombination. V(D)J recombination takes place in immature T and B cells and relies on the so-called RAG nuclease, a site-specific DNA cleavage apparatus that corresponds to the lymphoid-specific moiety of the VDJ recombinase. At the genome level, this recombinase's mission presents substantial biochemical challenges. These relate to the huge distance between (some of) the gene segments that it eventually rearranges and the need to achieve cell-lineage-restricted and developmentally ordered routines with at times, mono-allelic versus bi-allelic discrimination. The entire process must be completed without any recombination errors, instigators of chromosome instability, translocation and, potentially, tumorigenesis. As expected, such a precisely choreographed and yet potentially risky process demands sophisticated controls; epigenetics demonstrates what is possible when calling upon its many facets. In this vignette, we will recall the evidence that almost from the start appeared to link the two topics, V(D)J recombination and epigenetics, before reviewing the latest advances in our knowledge of this joint venture.},

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that these effects on immune function are important in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), and that modulation of the microbiome could be therapeutically beneficial in these conditions. In this Review, we examine the influence that the gut microbiota have on immune function via modulation of serotonin production in the gut and through complex interactions with components of the immune system, such as T cells and B cells. We then present evidence from studies in mice and humans that these effects of the gut microbiota on the immune system are important in the development and course of MS. We also consider how strategies for manipulating the composition of the gut microbiota could be used to influence disease-related immune dysfunction and form the basis of a new class of therapeutics. The strategies discussed include the use of probiotics, supplementation with bacterial metabolites, transplantation of faecal matter or defined microbial communities, and dietary intervention. Carefully designed studies with large human cohorts will be required to gain a full understanding of the microbiome changes involved in MS and to develop therapeutic strategies that target these changes.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare complication of infection with the Epstein--Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus that infects more than 90\% of the global population. This link was long suspected because the risk of MS increases markedly after infectious mononucleosis (symptomatic primary EBV infection) and with high titres of antibodies to specific EBV antigens. However, it was not until 2022 that a longitudinal study demonstrated that MS risk is minimal in individuals who are not infected with EBV and that it increases over 30-fold following EBV infection. Over the past few years, a number of studies have provided clues on the underlying mechanisms, which might help us to develop more targeted treatments for MS. In this Review, we discuss the evidence linking EBV to the development of MS and the mechanisms by which the virus is thought to cause the disease. Furthermore, we discuss implications for the treatment and prevention of MS, including the use of antivirals and vaccines. In this Review, the authors provide an overview of the evidence indicating that multiple sclerosis is a rare complication of infection with the Epstein--Barr virus and discuss the mechanisms that could underlie this association. In a longitudinal study that followed individuals seronegative for Epstein--Barr virus (EBV) over time, multiple sclerosis (MS) risk increased more than 30-fold after EBV infection. The results are unlikely to be explained by reverse causation or confounding factors.Among individuals who are EBV positive, those with a history of infectious mononucleosis or with high antibody titres against EBV nuclear antigens have an increased risk of developing MS.Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the link between EBV and MS, including molecular mimicry and an altered immune response to poorly controlled EBV infection.Vaccines that might prevent EBV infection are currently being developed. If effective, these vaccines would be expected to prevent most MS cases.Targeting EBV with therapeutic vaccines or antiviral drugs could represent a novel treatment strategy for MS.

Recent studies have provided compelling epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for a causal role of EBV in multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system and is thought to be triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by an infectious agent, with EBV as the lead candidate. How a ubiquitous virus that typically leads to benign latent infections can promote cancer and autoimmune disease in at-risk populations is not fully understood. Here we review the evidence that EBV is a causal agent for MS and how various risk factors may affect EBV infection and immune control. We focus on EBV contributing to MS through reprogramming of latently infected B lymphocytes and the chronic presentation of viral antigens as a potential source of autoreactivity through molecular mimicry. We consider how knowledge of EBVassociated cancers may be instructive for understanding the role of EBV in MS and discuss the potential for therapies that target EBV to treat MS.},

  abstract = {Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called ``normal-appearing'' non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified regionand cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes.},

  abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), can be suppressed in its early stages but eventually becomes clinically progressive and unresponsive to therapy. Here, we investigate whether the therapeutic resistance of progressive MS can be attributed to chronic immune cell accumulation behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Methods: We systematically track CNS-homing immune cells in the peripheral blood of 31 MS patients and 31 matched healthy individuals in an integrated analysis of 497,705 single-cell transcriptomes and 355,433 surface protein profiles from 71 samples. Through spatial RNA sequencing, we localize these cells in post mortem brain tissue of 6 progressive MS patients contrasted against 4 control brains (20 samples, 85,000 spot transcriptomes). Findings: We identify a specific pathogenic CD161+/lymphotoxin beta (LTB)+ T cell population that resides in brains of progressive MS patients. Intriguingly, our data suggest that the colonization of the CNS by these T cells may begin earlier in the disease course, as they can be mobilized to the blood by usage of the integrin-blocking antibody natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS patients. Conclusions: As a consequence, we lay the groundwork for a therapeutic strategy to deplete CNS-homing T cells before they can fuel treatment-resistant progression.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease in which active demyelination and neurodegeneration are associated with lymphocyte infiltrates in the brain. However, so far little is known regarding the phenotype and function of these infiltrating lymphocyte populations. In this study, we performed an in-depth phenotypic characterization of T and B cell infiltrates in a large set of multiple sclerosis cases with different disease and lesion stages and compared the findings with those seen in inflammatory, non-inflammatory and normal human controls. In multiple sclerosis lesions, we found a dominance of CD8+ T cells and a prominent contribution of CD20+ B cells in all disease courses and lesion stages, including acute multiple sclerosis cases with very short disease duration, while CD4+ T cells were sparse. A dominance of CD8+ T cells was also seen in other inflammatory controls, such as Rasmussen's encephalitis and viral encephalitis, but the contribution of B cells in these diseases was modest. Phenotypic analysis of the CD8+ T cells suggested that part of the infiltrating cells in active lesions proliferate, show an activated cytotoxic phenotype and are in part destroyed by apoptosis. Further characterization of the remaining cells suggest that CD8+ T cells acquire features of tissue-resident memory cells, which may be focally reactivated in active lesions of acute, relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis, while B cells, at least in part, gradually transform into plasma cells. The loss of surface molecules involved in the egress of leucocytes from inflamed tissue, such as S1P1 or CCR7, and the upregulation of CD103 expression may be responsible for the compartmentalization of the inflammatory response in established lesions. Similar phenotypic changes of tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were also seen in Rasmussen's encephalitis. Our data underline the potential importance of CD8+ T lymphocytes and B cells in the inflammatory response in established multiple sclerosis lesions. Tissue-resident T and B cells may represent guardians of previous inflammatory brain disease, which can be reactivated and sustain the inflammatory response, when they are re-exposed to their specific antigen.},

  abstract = {In multiple sclerosis (MS), iron accumulates inside activated microglia/macrophages at edges of some chronic demyelinated lesions, forming rims. In susceptibility-based magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T, iron-laden microglia/macrophages induce a rim of decreased signal at lesion edges and have been associated with slowly expanding lesions. We aimed to determine (1) what lesion types and stages are associated with iron accumulation at their edges, (2) what cells at the lesion edges accumulate iron and what is their activation status, (3) how reliably can iron accumulation at the lesion edge be detected by 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (4) if lesions with rims enlarge over time in vivo, when compared to lesions without rims. Double-hemispheric brain sections of 28 MS cases were stained for iron, myelin, and microglia/macrophages. Prior to histology, 4 of these 28 cases were imaged at 7 T using post-mortem susceptibility-weighted imaging. In vivo, seven MS patients underwent annual neurological examinations and 7 T MRI for 3.5 years, using a fluid attenuated inversion recovery/susceptibility-weighted imaging fusion sequence. Pathologically, we found iron rims around slowly expanding and some inactive lesions but hardly around remyelinated shadow plaques. Iron in rims was mainly present in microglia/macrophages with a pro-inflammatory activation status, but only very rarely in astrocytes. Histological validation of post-mortem susceptibility-weighted imaging revealed a quantitative threshold of iron-laden microglia when a rim was visible. Slowly expanding lesions significantly exceeded this threshold, when compared with inactive lesions (p = 0.003). We show for the first time that rim lesions significantly expanded in vivo after 3.5 years, compared to lesions without rims (p = 0.003). Thus, slow expansion of MS lesions with rims, which reflects chronic lesion activity, may, in the future, become an MRI marker for disease activity in MS.},

  abstract = {Background: In multiple sclerosis (MS), iron rim lesions (IRLs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been suggested as an imaging marker of disease progression. However, the exact mechanisms how they contribute to disability are yet not completely known. Strategic lesion location may be an important factor concerning the impact of focal lesions on clinical disability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution of IRLs compared to non-IRLs and their impact on disability. Methods: We retrospectively identified 67 patients with at least one IRL on MRI and 67 age- and sex-matched patients without IRLs. We compared the spatial distribution of lesions between both groups and between IRLs and non-IRLs in patients with IRLs. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between lesion localisation and disability on a voxel-by-voxel basis and investigated the impact on structural network disruptions. Results: Patients with IRLs had higher disability scores (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score (range): 3.0 (0 -- 8.5) versus 1.5 (0 -- 6.5); p = 0.001; median pyramidal functional system score (range): 1.0 (0 -- 5) versus 0 (0 -- 4); p = 0.003), significantly lower brain volumes (mean normal-appearing grey matter volume: 749.66 {\textpm} 60.58 versus 785.83 {\textpm} 53.71 mL; mean normal-appearing white matter volume: 723.58 {\textpm} 60.13 versus 753.25 {\textpm} 69.61 mL; mean deep grey matter volume: 33.21 {\textpm} 4.19 versus 35.85 {\textpm} 4.89 mL; p {$<$} 0.05 for all comparisons) and a significantly higher total T2 lesion volume (mean: 9.96 {\textpm} 11.6 versus 4.31 {\textpm} 8.9 mL; p {$<$} 0.001). We found no neuroanatomical regions that were more often affected by IRLs. Furthermore, comparing the overall network disruption in the IRL group, IRLs caused less network disruption/mL lesion size compared to non-IRLs (1.54\% / mL versus 2.0\% / mL; p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: IRLs are associated with higher disability scores. However, our results suggest that a higher disability is not explained by the sheer topography of IRLs or their network disruption.},

These patterns were suggested to represent heterogeneity of the underlying pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether lesion heterogeneity also exists in an unselected collection of autopsy material from patients with established MS.                                         Methods               All MS brain tissue available in the VU Medical Center was assessed for the presence of active demyelinating lesions using magnetic resonance imaging--guided sampling and immunohistochemistry. Tissue blocks containing active demyelinating lesions were evaluated for the presence of complement and antibody deposition, oligodendrocyte apoptosis, differential loss of myelin proteins, and hypoxia-like damage using histology, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Blocks with active demyelinating lesions were compared with blocks with active (nondemyelinating) and inactive lesions.                                         Results               Complement and antibodies were consistently associated with macrophages in areas of active demyelination. Preferential loss of myelin proteins, extensive hypoxia-like damage, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis were absent or rare. This pattern was observed in all tissue blocks containing active demyelinating lesions; lesion heterogeneity between patients was not found.                                         Interpretation               The immunopathological appearance of active demyelinating lesions in established MS is uniform. Initial heterogeneity of demyelinating lesions in the earliest phase of MS lesion formation may disappear over time as different pathways converge in one general mechanism of demyelination. Consistent presence of complement, antibodies, and Fc{$\gamma$} receptors in phagocytic macrophages suggests that antibody- and complement-mediated myelin phagocytosis is the dominant mechanism of demyelination in established MS.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess whether rim lesions are associated with patient disability and long-term lesion outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS We performed 3 studies at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center: (1) a prospective clinical/radiological cohort of 209 patients with MS (diagnosis according to the 2010 McDonald revised MS criteria, age 18 years, with 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI results) who were enrolled from January 2012 to March 2018 (of 209, 17 patients [8\%] were excluded because of uninterpretable MRI scans); (2) a radiological/pathological analysis of expanding lesions featuring rims; and (3) a retrospective longitudinal radiological study assessing long-term lesion evolution in 23 patients with MS with yearly MRI scans for 10 years or more (earliest scan, 1992). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES (1) Identification of chronic rim lesions on 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI in 192 patients with MS and the association of rim counts with clinical disability (primary analysis) and brain volume changes (exploratory analysis). (2) Pathological characterization of 10 expanding lesions from an adult with progressive MS who came to autopsy after 7 years of receiving serial in vivo MRI scans. (3) Evaluation of annual lesion volume change (primary analysis) and T1 times (exploratory analysis) in 27 rim lesions vs 27 rimless lesions. RESULTS Of 209 participants, 104 (50\%) were women and 32 (15\%) were African American. One hundred seventeen patients (56\%) had at least 1 rim lesion regardless of prior or ongoing treatment. Further, 84 patients (40\%) had no rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [14] years), 66 (32\%) had 1 to 3 rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years), and 42 (20\%) had 4 rims or more (mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years). Individuals with 4 rim lesions or more reached motor and cognitive disability at an earlier age. Normalized volumes of brain, white matter, and basal ganglia were lower in those with rim lesions. Whereas rimless lesions shrank over time (-3.6\%/year), rim lesions were stable in size or expanded (2.2\%/year; P {$<$} .001). Rim lesions had longer T1 times, suggesting more tissue destruction, than rimless lesions. On histopathological analysis, all 10 rim lesions that expanded in vivo had chronic active inflammation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Chronic active lesions are common, are associated with more aggressive disease, exert ongoing tissue damage, and occur even in individuals treated with effective disease-modifying therapies. These results prompt the planning of MRI-based clinical trials aimed at treating perilesional chronic inflammation in MS.},

However, areas within expanding MS lesions may exhibit prominent oligodendrocyte loss and apoptosis in the absence of infiltrating lymphocytes. The present study was designed to further investigate the inflammatory profile of different regions within rapidly expanding MS lesions.                                         Methods               Twenty-six active lesions from 11 patients with early MS were serially sectioned and immunostained for T and B cells, plasma cells, ramified microglia, macrophages, monocytes, and CD209-positive dendritic cells. Cell counts were compared in prephagocytic, phagocytic, and immediately postphagocytic areas.                                         Results               Parenchymal T and B cells were largely absent in areas of initial oligodendrocyte loss and in areas of degenerate and dead myelin infiltrated by myelin phagocytes. In contrast, trailing areas of complete demyelination packed with lipid macrophages, and, in some lesions, regenerating oligodendrocytes, showed large numbers of T cells, B cells, and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive plasma cells. Lesions in 2 exceptionally early cases contained relatively few T and B cells, and no IgG-positive plasma cells.                                         Interpretation               Early loss of oligodendrocytes is a prominent feature in tissue bordering rapidly expanding MS lesions. Macrophage activity is largely an innate scavenging response to the presence of degenerate and dead myelin. Adaptive immune activity involving T and B cells is conspicuous chiefly in recently demyelinated tissue, which may show signs of oligodendrocyte regeneration. The findings suggest that plaque formation has some basis other than destructive cell-mediated immunity directed against a myelin or oligodendrocyte antigen. Ann Neurol 2009;66:739--753},

  abstract = {Abstract             Monocyte/macrophage differentiation was studied in biopsy samples of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions obtained in the early course of the disease. Macrophages were identified by immunocytochemistry using a panel of antibodies recognizing different macrophage-activation antigens. The number of cells stained with each antibody was related to the demyelinating activity of the lesions as detected by the presence of myelin degradation products. The pan-macrophage Marchker Ki-M1P revealed the highest numbers of macrophages in early and late active lesions. Lower numbers were encountered in inactive, demyelinated, or remyelinated lesions. The acute stage inflammatory macrophage Marchkers MRP14 and 27E10 were expressed in either only early active (MRP14) or early and late active (27E10) lesions, thus allowing the identification of actively demyelinating lesions. The chronic stage inflammatory macrophage Marchker 25F9, in contrast, showed increasing expression with decreasing lesional activity. These findings indicate a differentiated pattern of macrophage activation in MS lesions and allow the staging of demyelinating lesions in routinely fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifocal and progressive inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the compartmentalized pathology of the disease affecting various anatomical regions including gray and white matter and lack of appropriate disease models impede understanding of the disease. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and multiplex spatial RNA mapping, we generated an integrated transcriptomic map comprising leukocortical, cerebellar and spinal cord areas in normal and MS tissues that captures regional subtype diversity of various cell types with an emphasis on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. While we found strong cross-regional diversity among glial subtypes in control tissue, regional signatures become more obscure in MS. This suggests that patterns of transcriptomic changes in MS are shared across regions and converge on specific pathways, especially those regulating cellular stress and immune activation. In addition, we found evidence that a subtype of white matter oligodendrocytes appearing across all three CNS regions adopt pro-remyelinating gene signatures in MS. In summary, our data suggest that cross-regional transcriptomic glial signatures overlap in MS, with different reactive glial cell types capable of either exacerbating or ameliorating pathology.},

  abstract = {In multiple sclerosis (MS), sustained inflammatory activity can be visualized by iron-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the edges of chronic lesions. These paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are associated with clinical worsening, although the cell type-specific and molecular pathways of iron uptake and metabolism are not well known. We studied two postmortem cohorts: an exploratory formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue cohort of 18 controls and 24 MS cases and a confirmatory snap-frozen cohort of 6 controls and 14 MS cases. Besides myelin and non-heme iron imaging, the haptoglobinhemoglobin scavenger receptor CD163, the iron-metabolizing markers HMOX1 and HAMP as well as immune-related markers P2RY12, CD68, C1QA and IL10 were visualized in myeloid cell (MC) subtypes at RNA and protein levels across different MS lesion areas. In addition, we studied PRLs in vivo in a cohort of 98 people with MS (pwMS) via iron-sensitive 3 T MRI and haptoglobin genotyping by PCR. CSF samples were available from 38 pwMS for soluble CD163 (sCD163) protein level measurements by ELISA. In postmortem tissues, we observed that iron uptake was linked to rim-associated C1QA-expressing MC subtypes, characterized by upregulation of CD163, HMOX1, HAMP and, conversely, downregulation of P2RY12. We found that pwMS with {$\geq$} 4 PRLs had higher sCD163 levels in the CSF than pwMS with {$\leq$} 3 PRLs with sCD163 correlating with the number of PRLs. The number of PRLs was associated with clinical worsening but not with age, sex or haptoglobin genotype of pwMS. However, pwMS with Hp2-1/Hp2-2 haplotypes had higher clinical disability scores than pwMS with Hp11. In summary, we observed upregulation of the CD163-HMOX1-HAMP axis in MC subtypes at chronic active lesion rims, suggesting haptoglobin-bound hemoglobin but not transferrin-bound iron as a critical source for MC-associated iron uptake in MS. The correlation of CSF-associated sCD163 with PRL counts in MS highlights the relevance of CD163-mediated iron uptake via haptoglobin-bound hemoglobin. Also, while Hp haplotypes had no noticeable influence on PRL counts, pwMS carriers of a Hp2 allele might have a higher risk to experience clinical worsening.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) and one of the leading causes of neurological deficits and disability in young adults in western countries. Current medical treatment mainly influences disease progression via immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive actions. Indeed, MS research has been foremost focused on inflammation in the CNS, but more recent evidence suggests that chronic disability in MS is caused by neurodegeneration. Imaging studies show an early involvement of neurodegeneration as brain atrophy and gray matter lesions can be observed at disease onset. Thus, neuroprotective treatment strategies and the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in MS have attracted the attention of the scientific community. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; the most commonly used animal model for MS), novel in-vivo imaging techniques such as two-photon microscopy and recently discovered molecular changes have offered new insights into the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation as well as neurodegeneration in MS. This review focuses on the interaction between components of the immune system and the neuronal compartment, as well as describing the most important molecular mechanisms that lead to axonal and neuronal degeneration in MS and EAE.},

  abstract = {Objective Ongoing neuroaxonal damage is a major contributor to disease progression and long-term disability in multiple sclerosis. However, spatio-temporal distribution and pathophysiological mechanisms of neuroaxonal damage during acute relapses and later chronic disease stages remain poorly understood. Methods Here, we applied immunohistochemistry, single-molecule array, spatial transcriptomics, and microglia/ axon co-cultures to gain insight into spatio-temporal neuroaxonal damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Results Association of spinal cord white matter lesions and blood-based neurofilament light (sNfL) levels revealed a distinct, stage-dependent anatomical pattern of neuroaxonal damage: in chronic EAE, sNfL levels were predominately associated with anterolateral lumbar lesions, whereas in early EAE sNfL showed no correlation with lesions in any anatomical location. Furthermore, neuroaxonal damage in late EAE was largely confined to white matter lesions but showed a widespread distribution in early EAE. Following this pattern of neuroaxonal damage, spatial transcriptomics revealed a widespread cyto- and chemokine response at early disease stages, whereas late EAE was characterized by a prominent glial cell accumulation in white matter lesions. These findings were corroborated by immunohistochemistry and microglia/axon co-cultures, which further revealed a strong association between CNS myeloid cell activation and neuroaxonal damage both in vivo and in vitro. Interpretation Our findings indicate that CNS myeloid cells may play a crucial role in driving neuroaxonal damage in EAE. Moreover, neuroaxonal damage can progress in a stage-dependent centripetal manner, transitioning from normal-appearing white matter to focal white matter lesions. These insights may contribute to a better understanding of neurodegeneration and elevated sNfL levels observed in multiple sclerosis patients at different disease stages.},

Drug development to prevent disease progression is an urgent clinical need yet is constrained by an incomplete understanding of its complex pathogenesis. Using spatial transcriptomics and proteomics on fresh-frozen human MS brain tissue, we identified multicellular mechanisms of progressive MS pathogenesis and traced their origin in relation to spatially distributed stages of neurodegeneration. By resolving ligand--receptor interactions in local microenvironments, we discovered defunct trophic and anti-inflammatory intercellular communications within areas of early neuronal decline. Proteins associated with neuronal damage in patient samples showed mechanistic concordance with published in vivo knockdown and central nervous system (CNS) disease models, supporting their causal role and value as potential therapeutic targets in progressive MS. Our findings provide a new framework for drug development strategies, rooted in an understanding of the complex cellular and signaling dynamics in human diseased tissue that facilitate this debilitating disease.

Genome-wide association studies revealed more than 200 risk loci, most of which harbour genes primarily expressed in immune cells. However, whether genetic differences are translated into cell-specific gene expression profiles and to what extent these are altered in patients with multiple sclerosis are still open questions in the field. To assess cell type-specific gene expression in a large cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis, we sequenced the whole transcriptome of fluorescence-activated cell sorted T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and CD14+ monocytes from treatment-naive patients with multiple sclerosis (n\,=\,106) and healthy subjects (n\,=\,22). We identified 479 differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells, 435 in monocytes, and 54 in CD8+ T cells. Importantly, in CD4+ T cells, we discovered upregulated transcripts from the NAE1 gene, a critical subunit of the NEDD8 activating enzyme, which activates the neddylation pathway, a post-translational modification analogous to ubiquitination. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme using the specific inhibitor pevonedistat (MLN4924) significantly ameliorated disease severity in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our findings provide novel insights into multiple sclerosis-associated gene regulation unravelling neddylation as a crucial pathway in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis with implications for the development of tailored disease-modifying agents.},

  abstract = {Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) encompass a highly diverse set of cells abundantly present in every tissue and organ. RTMs are recognized as central players in innate immune responses, and more recently their importance beyond host defense has started to be highlighted. Despite sharing a universal name and several canonical markers, RTMs perform remarkably specialized activities tailored to sustain critical homeostatic functions of the organs they reside in. These cells can mediate neuronal communication, participate in metabolic pathways, and secrete growth factors. In this Review, we summarize how the division of labor among different RTM subsets helps support tissue homeostasis. We discuss how the local microenvironment influences the development of RTMs, the molecular processes they support, and how dysregulation of RTMs can lead to disease. Last, we highlight both the similarities and tissue-specific distinctions of key RTM subsets, aiming to coalesce recent classifications and perspectives into a unified view.           ,              Division of labor among resident tissue macrophages is vital for proper tissue function during homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative disease that is driven by immune system-mediated demyelination of nerve axons. While diseases such as cancer, HIV, malaria and even COVID have realised notable benefits from the attention of the mathematical community, MS has received significantly less attention despite the increasing disease incidence rates, lack of curative treatment, and long-term impact on patient well-being. In this review, we highlight existing, MS-specific mathematical research and discuss the outstanding challenges and open problems that remain for mathematicians. We focus on how both non-spatial and spatial deterministic models have been used to successfully further our understanding of T cell responses and treatment in MS. We also review how agent-based models and other stochastic modelling techniques have begun to shed light on the highly stochastic and oscillatory nature of this disease. Reviewing the current mathematical work in MS, alongside the biology specific to MS immunology, it is clear that mathematical research dedicated to understanding immunotherapies in cancer or the immune responses to viral infections could be readily translatable to MS and might hold the key to unlocking some of its mysteries.},

Here we developed a general data-driven method called CM-Drug for screening compounds that can boost ICB treatment efficacy based on core and minor gene sets identified between responsive and nonresponsive samples in ICB therapy. The CM-Drug method was validated using melanoma and lung cancer mouse models, with combined therapeutic efficacy demonstrated in eight of nine predicted compounds. Among these compounds, taltirelin had the strongest synergistic effect. Mechanistic analysis and experimental verification demonstrated that taltirelin can stimulate CD8+ T cells and is mediated by the induction of thyroid-stimulating hormone. This study provides an effective and general method for predicting and evaluating drugs for combination therapy and identifies candidate compounds for future ICB combination therapy. Here the authors present a method they call CM-Drug for the identification of combination drugs that can boost the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. They validate this method with melanoma and lung cancer models in mice and explore in further depth one hit from their screen, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analog taltirelin.},

  abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) is a pleiotropic immune cytokine that belongs to the TNF superfamily of receptor ligands. The cytokine exists as either a transmembrane or a soluble molecule, and targets two distinct receptors, TNF-{$\alpha$} receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF-{$\alpha$} receptor 2 (TNFR2), which activate different signaling cascades and downstream genes. TNF-{$\alpha$} cellular responses depend on its molecular form, targeted receptor, and concentration levels. TNF-{$\alpha$} plays a multifaceted role in normal physiology that is highly relevant to human health and disease. In the central nervous system (CNS), this cytokine regulates homeostatic functions, such as neurogenesis, myelination, blood-brain barrier permeability and synaptic plasticity. However, it can also potentiate neuronal excitotoxicity and CNS inflammation. The pleiotropism of TNF-{$\alpha$} and its various roles in the CNS, whether homeostatic or deleterious, only emphasizes the functional complexity of this cytokine. Anti-TNF-{$\alpha$} therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in treating various autoimmune inflammatory diseases and has emerged as a significant treatment option for CNS autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that the effects of this therapeutic target are diverse and complex. Contrary to initial expectations, anti-TNF-{$\alpha$} therapy has been found to have detrimental effects in multiple sclerosis. This article focuses on describing the various roles, both physiological and pathological, of TNF-{$\alpha$} in the CNS. Additionally, it discusses the specific disease processes that are dependent or regulated by TNF-{$\alpha$} and the rationale of its use as a therapeutic target.},

Studies on monozygotic twins discordant for MS offer a unique way to reduce this complexity and reveal discrepant subsets. Methods: In this study, we analyzed B cell subsets in blood samples of monozygotic twins with and without MS using publicly available data. We verified functional characteristics by exploring the role of therapy and performed separate analyses in unrelated individuals. Findings: The frequencies of CXCR3+ memory B cells were reduced in the blood of genetically identical twins with MS compared to their unaffected twin siblings. Natalizumab (anti-VLA-4 antibody) was the only treatment regimen under which these frequencies were reversed. The CNS-homing features of CXCR3+ memory B cells were supported by elevated CXCL10 levels in MS cerebrospinal fluid and their in vitro propensity to develop into antibody-secreting cells. Conclusions: Circulating CXCR3+ memory B cells are affected by nonheritable cues in people who develop MS. This underlines the requirement of environmental risk factors such as Epstein-Barr virus in triggering these B cells. We propose that after CXCL10-mediated entry into the CNS, CXCR3+ memory B cells mature into antibody-secreting cells to drive MS.},

These mice have diverse human B cell and T cell antigen receptor repertoires and can mount mature T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antibody responses, entailing somatic hypermutation, class-switch recombination, and plasma cell and memory B cell differentiation.

  abstract = {The blood--brain barrier (BBB) restricts molecular and cellular trafficking between the blood and the CNS. Although astrocytes are known to control BBB permeability, the molecular determinants of this effect remain unknown. We show that angiotensinogen (AGT) produced and secreted by astrocytes is cleaved into angiotensin II (AngII) and acts on type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT               1               ) expressed by BBB endothelial cells (ECs). Activation of AT               1               restricts the passage of molecular tracers across human BBB-derived ECs through threonine-phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin and its mobilization to lipid raft membrane microdomains. We also show that AGT knock-out animals have disorganized occludin strands at the level of the BBB and a diffuse accumulation of the endogenous serum protein plasminogen in the CNS, compared with wild-type animals. Finally, we demonstrate a reduction in the number of AGT-immunopositive perivascular astrocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, which correlates with a reduced expression of occludin similarly seen in the CNS of AGT knock-out animals. Such a reduction in astrocyte-expressed AGT and AngII is dependent,               in vitro               , on the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} and interferon-{$\gamma$}. Our study defines a novel physiological role for AngII in the CNS and suggests that inflammation-induced downregulation of AngII production by astrocytes is involved in BBB dysfunction in MS lesions.},

  abstract = {Background: Progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by compartmentalized smoldering neuroinflammation caused by the proliferation of immune cells residing in the central nervous system (CNS), including B cells. Although inflammatory activity can be prevented by immunomodulatory therapies during early disease, such therapies typically fail to halt disease progression. CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have revolutionized the field of hematologic malignancies. Although generally considered efficacious, serious adverse events associated with CAR-T cell therapies such as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) have been observed. Successful use of CD19 CAR-T cells in rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and neuroimmunological diseases like myasthenia gravis have recently been observed, suggesting possible application in other autoimmune diseases. Methods: Here, we report the first individual treatment with a fully human CD19 CAR-T cell therapy (KYV-101) in two patients with progressive MS. Findings: CD19 CAR-T cell administration resulted in acceptable safety profiles for both patients. No ICANS was observed despite detection of CD19 CAR-T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. In case 1, intrathecal antibody production in the cerebrospinal fluid decreased notably after CAR-T cell infusion and was sustained through day 64. Conclusions: CD19 CAR-T cell administration in progressive MS resulted in an acceptable safety profile. CAR-T cell presence and expansion were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid without clinical signs of neurotoxicity, which, along with intrathecal antibody reduction, indicates expansion-dependent effects of CAR-T cells on CD19+ target cells in the CNS. Larger clinical studies assessing CD19 CAR-T cells in MS are warranted.},

  abstract = {Background: Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF{$\beta$}1) is strongly induced following brain injury and polarises microglia to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Augmentation of TGF{$\beta$}1 responses may therefore be beneficial in preventing inflammation in neurological disorders including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. However, several other cell types display immunogenic potential and identifying the effect of TGF{$\beta$}1 on these cells is required to more fully understand its effects on brain inflammation. Pericytes are multifunctional cells which ensheath the brain vasculature and have garnered recent attention with respect to their immunomodulatory potential. Here, we sought to investigate the inflammatory phenotype adopted by TGF{$\beta$}1-stimulated human brain pericytes. Methods: Microarray analysis was performed to examine transcriptome-wide changes in TGF{$\beta$}1-stimulated pericytes, and results were validated by qRT-PCR and cytometric bead arrays. Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and LDH/Alamar Blue{\textregistered} viability assays were utilised to examine phagocytic capacity of human brain pericytes, transcription factor modulation and pericyte health. Results: TGF{$\beta$}1 treatment of primary human brain pericytes induced the expression of several inflammatory-related genes (NOX4, COX2, IL6 and MMP2) and attenuated others (IL8, CX3CL1, MCP1 and VCAM1). A synergistic induction of IL-6 was seen with IL-1{$\beta$}/TGF{$\beta$}1 treatment whilst TGF{$\beta$}1 attenuated the IL-1{$\beta$}-induced expression of CX3CL1, MCP-1 and sVCAM-1. TGF{$\beta$}1 was found to signal through SMAD2/3 transcription factors but did not modify nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) translocation. Furthermore, TGF{$\beta$}1 attenuated the phagocytic ability of pericytes, possibly through downregulation of the scavenger receptors CD36, CD47 and CD68. Whilst TGF{$\beta$} did decrease pericyte number, this was due to a reduction in proliferation, not apoptotic death or compromised cell viability. Conclusions: TGF{$\beta$}1 attenuated pericyte expression of key chemokines and adhesion molecules involved in CNS leukocyte trafficking and the modulation of microglial function, as well as reduced the phagocytic ability of pericytes. However, TGF{$\beta$}1 also enhanced the expression of classical pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes which can disrupt BBB functioning, suggesting that pericytes adopt a phenotype which is neither solely pro- nor anti-inflammatory. Whilst the effects of pericyte modulation by TGF{$\beta$}1 in vivo are difficult to infer, the reduction in pericyte proliferation together with the elevated IL-6, MMP-2 and NOX4 and reduced phagocytosis suggests a detrimental action of TGF{$\beta$}1 on neurovasculature.},

  abstract = {Immunization is a cornerstone of public health policy and is demonstrably highly cost-effective when used to protect child health. Although it could be argued that immunology has not thus far contributed much to vaccine development, in that most of the vaccines we use today were developed and tested empirically, it is clear that there are major challenges ahead to develop new vaccines for difficult-to-target pathogens, for which we urgently need a better understanding of protective immunity. Moreover, recognition of the huge potential and challenges for vaccines to control disease outbreaks and protect the older population, together with the availability of an array of new technologies, make it the perfect time for immunologists to be involved in designing the next generation of powerful immunogens. This Review provides an introductory overview of vaccines, immunization and related issues and thereby aims to inform a broad scientific audience about the underlying immunological concepts.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, still represents one of the most common causes of persisting disability with an early disease onset. Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS---namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly. Finally, we cover the current knowledge on repopulation of CD20+ cells after cessation of anti-CD20 treatment and discuss future aspirations towards alternative, further developed B cell silencing therapies.},

The method typically involves short-term incubation of whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells with antigens of interest, where autologous antigen-presenting cells process and present peptides in complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Recognition of peptide--MHC complexes by T-cell receptors then induces upregulation of activation markers on the T cells that can be detected by flow cytometry. In this review, we highlight the most widely used activation markers for assays in the literature while identifying nuances and potential downfalls associated with the technique. We provide a summary of how AIM assays have been used in both discovery science and clinical studies, including studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunity. This review primarily focuses on AIM assays using human blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples, with some considerations noted for tissue-derived T cells and nonhuman samples. AIM assays are a powerful tool that enables detailed analysis of antigen-specific T-cell frequency, phenotype and function without needing to know the precise antigenic peptides and their MHC restriction elements, enabling a wider analysis of immunity generated following infection and/or vaccination.},

We integrated transcriptional data of over 3,000 samples, from 820 adults across 28 studies of 13 vaccines and analyzed vaccination-induced signatures of antibody responses. Most vaccines induced signatures of innate immunity and plasmablasts at days 1 and 7, respectively, after vaccination. However, the yellow fever vaccine induced an early transient signature of T and B cell activation at day 1, followed by delayed antiviral/interferon and plasmablast signatures that peaked at days 7 and 14--21, respectively. Thus, there was no evidence for a `universal signature' that predicted antibody response to all vaccines. However, accounting for the asynchronous nature of responses, we defined a time-adjusted signature that predicted antibody responses across vaccines. These results provide a transcriptional atlas of immunity to vaccination and define a common, time-adjusted signature of antibody responses. Pulendran and colleagues perform a comparative analysis of transcriptional responses of healthy young adults across 13 different vaccines. They find that while a common transcriptional program is shared across many vaccines, there is significant heterogeneity especially in the kinetics of immune responses.},

During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), myeloid complexity drastically increases, with dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes seeding the CNS. However, which disease-specific populations can be found during neuroinflammation remains largely unknown.                                         RATIONALE               An important step for the initiation of EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS) is the infiltration of the CNS by encephalitogenic T cells, which potentially become reactivated by encountering their self-cognate antigens presented at the brain interfaces. Myeloid cells have been shown to play a critical role in antigen presentation. Consequently, their transcriptomic profile and dynamics during neuroinflammation are crucial for understanding neuroinflammatory pathology.                                         RESULTS                                High-throughput single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45                 +                 cells isolated from several CNS compartments (including leptomeninges, perivascular space and parenchyma, and choroid plexus) allowed us to assemble a transcriptional atlas comprising 3461 immune cells, identified as homeostatic (``h'') or disease-associated (``da'') myeloid subsets. Profiling of all CAMs unraveled a core signature that consists of                 Mrc1                 ,                 Pf4                 ,                 Ms4a7                 ,                 Stab1                 , and                 Cbr2                 . During disease, only                 Ms4a7                 remained stably expressed, and a strong increase of antigen-presentation molecules (such as                 Cd74                 ) was observed.

Several monocyte populations were observed during EAE, including monocyte-derived cells expressing                 Mertk                 and                 Mrc1                 or expressing                 Zbtb46                 and                 Cd209a                 . Although DCs were scarce in the homeostatic CNS, their density highly increased during disease, and diverse disease-associated DCs could be identified.                                               We next established the spatiotemporal relationship between infiltrating monocytes and resident macrophages using the                                    Cx3cr1                   CreERT2                                  system. Local proliferation of resident macrophages occurred alongside continuous monocytic infiltration up to the peak of disease. Monocytes were transiently integrated into the CNS, and resident macrophages underwent apoptosis during the chronic phase. An evaluation of microglial expansion by using                                    Cx3cr1                   CreER                   :R26                   Confetti                                  mice revealed their clonal expansion during neuroinflammation.                                               We then investigated the capacity of resident and hematopoietic stem cell--derived myeloid cells for antigen presentation. Time-lapse imaging of                                    Cx3cr1                   CreERT2                   :R26                   tdTomato                                  :                                    Cd2                   GFP                                  and                                    Ccr2                   RFP                                  :                                    Cd2                   GFP                                  mice showed prolonged T cell interactions with circulating myeloid cells rather than tissue-resident macrophages during neuroinflammation. Accordingly, MOG                 35-55                 immunization of                                    Cx3cr1                   CreERT2                   :H2-Ab1                   flox                                  mice showed no overt changes in disease development, indicating that resident macrophages are redundant for antigen presentation. By contrast,                                    Cd11c                   Cre                   :H2-Ab1                   flox                                  mice were highly resistant to EAE, pointing to the potential role of DCs and monocyte-derived cells in EAE onset.                                                        CONCLUSION               In this study, we unraveled the complexity of the CNS myeloid landscape and the dynamics of several myeloid populations during neuroinflammation. Although CNS-resident macrophages quickly generated context-dependent subsets during disease, their role as APCs was irrelevant for the initiation of pathology. DCs and monocyte-derived cells, highly diverse during EAE, remain the major players in antigen presentation. The comprehensive characterization presented here will provide a strong basis for their future targeting.                                                   Myeloid cell diversity during neuroinflammation.                   The homeostatic CNS includes microglia and different CAMs. During disease, microglia clonally expand, and the transcriptomic profile of microglia and CAMs drastically change. Diverse DC and monocyte subsets simultaneously populate the CNS. The role of resident macrophages for antigen presentation is redundant, whereas DCs and/or monocyte-derived populations show high antigen-presentation capacity, pointing to their crucial role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.                                                                         ,              The innate immune cell compartment is highly diverse in the healthy central nervous system (CNS), including parenchymal and non-parenchymal macrophages. However, this complexity is increased in inflammatory settings by the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells. It is unclear which disease-specific myeloid subsets exist and what their transcriptional profiles and dynamics during CNS pathology are. Combining deep single-cell transcriptome analysis, fate mapping, in vivo imaging, clonal analysis, and transgenic mouse lines, we comprehensively characterized unappreciated myeloid subsets in several CNS compartments during neuroinflammation. During inflammation, CNS macrophage subsets undergo self-renewal, and random proliferation shifts toward clonal expansion. Last, functional studies demonstrated that endogenous CNS tissue macrophages are redundant for antigen presentation. Our results highlight myeloid cell diversity and provide insights into the brain's innate immune system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. In some active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, a strong immune reaction at the lesion edge may contain growth and thereby isolate the lesion from the surrounding parenchyma. Our previous studies suggest that this process involves opening of the blood-brain barrier in capillaries at the lesion edge, seen on MRI as centripetal contrast enhancement and a colocalized phase rim. We hypothesized that using these features to characterize early lesion evolution will allow in vivo tracking of tissue degeneration and/or repair, thus improving the evaluation of potential therapies for chronic active lesions. METHODS. Centripetally and centrifugally enhancing lesions were studied in 17 patients with MS using 7-tesla MRI. Highresolution, susceptibility-weighted, T1-weighted (before/after gadolinium), and dynamic contrast--enhanced scans were acquired at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, and 12. For each lesion, time evolution of the phase rim, lesion volume, and T1 hypointensity were assessed. In autopsies of 3 progressive MS cases, the histopathology of the phase rim was determined. RESULTS. In centripetal lesions, a phase rim colocalized with initial contrast enhancement. In 12 of 22, this phase rim persisted after enhancement resolved. Compared with centripetal lesions with transient rim, those with persistent rim had less volume shrinkage and became more T1 hypointense between months 3 and 12. No centrifugal lesions developed phase rims at any time point. Pathologically, persistent rims corresponded to an iron-laden inflammatory myeloid cell population at the edge of chronic demyelinated lesions. CONCLUSION. In early lesion evolution, a persistent phase rim in lesions that shrink least and become more T1 hypointense over time suggests that the rim might mark failure of early lesion repair and/or irreversible tissue damage. In later stages of MS, phase rim lesions continue to smolder, exerting detrimental effects on affected brain tissue.},

  abstract = {Background: Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages of the CNS. They originate in the yolk sac, colonize the CNS during embryonic development and form a self-sustaining population with limited turnover. A consequence of their relative slow turnover is that microglia can serve as a long-term memory for inflammatory or neurodegenerative events. Methods: Using ATAC-, ChIP- and RNA-sequencing, we characterized the epigenomes and transcriptomes of FACSpurified microglia from mice exposed to different stimuli. A repeated endotoxin challenge (LPS) was used to induce tolerance in microglia, while genotoxic stress (DNA repair deficiency-induced accelerated aging through Ercc1 deficiency) resulted in primed (hypersensitive) microglia. Results: Whereas the enrichment of permissive epigenetic marks at enhancer regions could explain training (hyperresponsiveness) of primed microglia to an LPS challenge, the tolerized response of microglia seems to be regulated by loss of permissive epigenetic marks. We identify that inflammatory stimuli and accelerated aging as a result of genotoxic stress activate distinct gene networks. These gene networks and associated biological processes are partially overlapping, which is likely driven by specific transcription factor networks, resulting in altered epigenetic signatures and distinct functional (desensitized vs. primed) microglia phenotypes. Conclusion: This study provides insight into epigenetic profiles and transcription factor networks associated with transcriptional signatures of tolerized and trained microglia in vivo, leading to a better understanding of innate immune memory of microglia.},

These cells adopt distinct transcriptional subtypes known as states. Understanding state function, especially in human microglia, has been elusive owing to a lack of tools to model and manipulate these cells. Here, we developed a platform for modeling human microglia transcriptional states in vitro. We found that exposure of human stem-cell-differentiated microglia to synaptosomes, myelin debris, apoptotic neurons or synthetic amyloid-beta fibrils generated transcriptional diversity that mapped to gene signatures identified in human brain microglia, including disease-associated microglia, a state enriched in neurodegenerative diseases. Using a new lentiviral approach, we demonstrated that the transcription factor MITF drives a disease-associated transcriptional signature and a highly phagocytic state. Together, these tools enable the manipulation and functional interrogation of human microglial states in both homeostatic and disease-relevant contexts.},

Methods               In this paper, a large-scale cross-trait Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) was conducted to investigate the genetic overlap among rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes.                                         Results and discussion               Through the local genetic correlation analysis, 2 regions with locally significant genetic associations between rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and 4 regions with locally significant genetic associations between rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes were discovered. By cross-trait meta-analysis, 58 independent loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, 86 independent loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and 107 independent loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes were identified with genome-wide significance. In addition, 82 common risk genes were found through genetic identification. Based on gene set enrichment analysis, it was found that shared genes are enriched in exposed dermal system, calf, musculoskeletal, subcutaneous fat, thyroid and other tissues, and are also significantly enriched in 35 biological pathways. To verify the association between diseases, Mendelian randomized analysis was performed, which shows possible causal associations between rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and between rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. The common genetic structure of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes was explored by these studies, and it is believed that this important discovery will lead to new ideas for clinical treatment.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Intervention with interferon-\&bgr; (IFN\&bgr;) therapy counters early inflammatory damage to myelin and protects axons; such therapy might demonstrate greater efficacy earlier in the disease course compared with later when permanent damage has already occurred. Clinical trials conducted in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) show clinical benefits of early treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), as evidenced by delayed conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and reduced disability 3 years later; however, statistical significance is lost at 5 years. Moreover, in the CIS trials, patients who began treatment later in the course of MS did not benefit as much as those who began treatment earlier. In the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), immunomodulatory drug (IMD) therapy markedly reduced relapse rates and the burden of disease, as assessed by MRI. IFN\&bgr; therapy has demonstrated greater benefits in RRMS than in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The SPMS trials consistently show reduction in relapse rates and accumulation of new MRI lesions, but have conflicting results for time to disability progression, which is the primary outcome measure in SPMS trials. Current evidence suggests that IFN\&bgr; therapy may be more effective in the early stages of SPMS, characterized by relapsing episodes and MRI evidence of greater brain lesion disease activity. Thus, intervention with IFN\&bgr; therapy is appropriate for all stages of MS except PPMS or non-relapsing SPMS. Intervention with glatiramer acetate is appropriate for RRMS. The balance of evidence indicates that early therapy is essential to delay the accumulation of irreversible neurologic damage and consequent disability.

  abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide expansions in the huntingtin gene. Markers of both systemic and CNS immune activation and inflammation have been widely noted in HD and mouse models of HD. In particular, elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the earliest reported marker of immune activation in HD, and this elevation has been suggested to contribute to HD pathogenesis. To test the hypothesis that IL-6 deficiency would be protective against the effects of mutant huntingtin, we generated R6/2 HD model mice that lacked IL-6. Contrary to our prediction, IL-6 deficiency exacerbated HD-model associated behavioral phenotypes. Single nuclear RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis of striatal cell types revealed that IL-6 deficiency led to the dysregulation of various genes associated with synaptic function, as well as the BDNF receptor Ntrk2. These data suggest that IL-6 deficiency exacerbates the effects of mutant huntingtin through dysregulation of genes of known relevance to HD pathobiology in striatal neurons, and further suggest that modulation of IL-6 to a level that promotes proper regulation of genes associated with synaptic function may hold promise as an HD therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Whereas T cells are likely the main drivers of disease development, the striking efficacy of B cell-depleting therapies (BCDTs) underscore B cells' involvement in disease progression. How B cells contribute to multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis---and consequently the precise mechanism of action of BCDTs---remains elusive. Here, we analyze the impact of BCDTs on the immune landscape in patients with MS using high-dimensional single-cell immunophenotyping. Algorithm-guided analysis reveals a decrease in circulating T follicular helper-like (Tfh-like) cells alongside increases in CD27 expression in memory T helper cells and Tfh-like cells. Elevated CD27 indicates disrupted CD27/CD70 signaling, as sustained CD27 activation in T cells leads to its cleavage. Immunohistological analysis shows CD70-expressing B cells at MS lesion sites. These results suggest that the efficacy of BCDTs may partly hinge upon the disruption of Th cell and B cell interactions.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with profound heterogeneity in clinical course, neuroradiological appearance of the lesions, involvement of susceptibility gene loci, and response to therapy. These features are supported by experimental evidence, which demonstrates that fundamentally different processes, such as autoimmunity or virus infection, may induce MS-like inflammatory demyelinating plaques and suggest that MS may be a disease with heterogeneous pathogenetic mechanisms. From a large pathology sample of MS, collected in three international centers, we selected 51 biopsies and 32 autopsies that contained actively demyelinating lesions defined by stringent criteria. The pathology of the lesions was analyzed using a broad spectrum of immunological and neurobiological markers. Four fundamentally different patterns of demyelination were found, defined on the basis of myelin protein loss, the geography and extension of plaques, the patterns of oligodendrocyte destruction, and the immunopathological evidence of complement activation. Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell--mediated or T-cell plus antibody--mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity. At a given time point of the disease---as reflected in autopsy cases---the patterns of demyelination were heterogeneous between patients, but were homogenous within multiple active lesions from the same patient. This pathogenetic heterogeneity of plaques from different MS patients may have fundamental implications for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease. Ann Neurol 2000;47:707--717},

By performing single-cell spatial expression profiling using in situ sequencing (ISS), we annotated disease neighborhoods and found centrifugal evolution of active lesions. We demonstrated that disease-associated (DA)-glia arise independently of lesions and are dynamically induced and resolved over the disease course. Single-cell spatial mapping of human archival MS spinal cords confirmed the differential distribution of homeostatic and DA-glia, enabled deconvolution of active and inactive lesions into sub-compartments, and identified new lesion areas. By establishing a spatial resource of mouse and human MS neuropathology at a single-cell resolution, our study unveils the intricate cellular dynamics underlying MS.},

  abstract = {Current therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) reduce both relapses and relapse-associated worsening of disability, which is assumed to be mainly associated with transient infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS). However, approved therapies are less effective at slowing disability accumulation in patients with MS, in part owing to their lack of relevant effects on CNS-compartmentalized inflammation, which has been proposed to drive disability. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an intracellular signalling molecule involved in the regulation of maturation, survival, migration and activation of B cells and microglia. As CNS-compartmentalized B cells and microglia are considered central to the immunopathogenesis of progressive MS, treatment with CNS-penetrant BTK inhibitors might curtail disease progression by targeting immune cells on both sides of the blood--brain barrier. Five BTK inhibitors that differ in selectivity, strength of inhibition, binding mechanisms and ability to modulate immune cells within the CNS are currently under investigation in clinical trials as a treatment for MS. This Review describes the role of BTK in various immune cells implicated in MS, provides an overview of preclinical data on BTK inhibitors and discusses the (largely preliminary) data from clinical trials.},

Neurohistological and neuroimaging studies support the presence of ongoing and end-stage neuroinflammatory processes in PD. Moreover, numerous studies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with PD suggest alterations in markers of inflammation and immune cell populations that could initiate or exacerbate neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. A number of disease genes and risk factors have been identified as modulators of immune function in PD and evidence is mounting for a role of viral or bacterial exposure, pesticides and alterations in gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that complex gene-by-environment interactions combine with an ageing immune system to create the `perfect storm' that enables the development and progression of PD. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis and opportunities to harness the emerging immunological knowledge from patients with PD to create better preclinical models with the long-term goal of enabling earlier identification of at-risk individuals to prevent, delay and more effectively treat the disease.},

  abstract = {The lack of understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) has hindered the search for new effective therapies. Here, to address this gap, we analysed 632,000 single nuclei RNAseq profiles of 156 brain tissue samples, comprising white matter (WM) lesions, normal appearing WM, grey matter (GM) lesions and normal appearing GM from 54 MS patients and 26 controls. We observed the expected changes in overall neuronal and glial numbers previously described within the classical lesion subtypes. We found highly cell type-specific gene expression changes in MS tissue, with distinct differences between GM and WM areas, confirming different pathologies. However, surprisingly, we did not observe distinct gene expression signatures for the classical different WM lesion types, rather a continuum of change. This indicates that classical lesion characterization better reflects changes in cell abundance than changes in cell type gene expression, and indicates a global disease effect. Furthermore, the major biological determinants of variability in gene expression in MS WM samples relate to individual patient effects, rather than to lesion types or other metadata. We identify four subgroups of MS patients with distinct WM glial gene expression signatures and patterns of oligodendrocyte stress and/or maturation, suggestive of engagement of different pathological processes, with an additional more variable regenerative astrocyte signature. The discovery of these patterns, which were also found in an independent MS patient cohort, provides a framework to use molecular biomarkers to stratify patients for optimal therapeutic approaches for progressive MS, significantly advances our mechanistic understanding of progressive MS, and highlights the need for precision-medicine approaches to address heterogeneity among MS patients.},

  abstract = {Using a philosophical approach or deductive reasoning, we challenge the dominant clinico-radiological worldview that defines multiple sclerosis (MS) as a focal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). We provide a range of evidence to argue that the `real MS' is in fact driven primarily by a smouldering pathological disease process. In natural history studies and clinical trials, relapses and focal activity revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in MS patients on placebo or on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) were found to be poor predictors of long-term disease evolution and were dissociated from disability outcomes. In addition, the progressive accumulation of disability in MS can occur independently of relapse activity from early in the disease course. This scenario is underpinned by a more diffuse smouldering pathological process that may affect the entire CNS. Many putative pathological drivers of smouldering MS can be potentially modified by specific therapeutic strategies, an approach that may have major implications for the management of MS patients. We hypothesise that therapeutically targeting a state of `no evident inflammatory disease activity' (NEIDA) cannot sufficiently prevent disability accumulation in MS, meaning that treatment should also focus on other brain and spinal cord pathological processes contributing to the slow loss of neurological function. This should also be complemented with a holistic approach to the management of other systemic disease processes that have been shown to worsen MS outcomes.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex chronic disease with an unknown etiology. It is considered an inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized, in most cases, by an unpredictable onset of relapse and remission phases. The disease generally starts in subjects under 40; it has a higher incidence in women and is described as a multifactorial disorder due to the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors. Unfortunately, there is currently no definitive cure for MS. Still, therapies can modify the disease's natural history, reducing the relapse rate and slowing the progression of the disease or managing symptoms. The limited access to human CNS tissue slows down. It limits the progression of research on MS. This limit has been partially overcome over the years by developing various experimental models to study this disease. Animal models of autoimmune demyelination, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and viral and toxin or transgenic MS models, represent the most significant part of MS research approaches. These models have now been complemented by ex vivo studies, using organotypic brain slice cultures and in vitro, through induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs). We will discuss which clinical features of the disorders might be reproduced and investigated in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro in models commonly used in MS research to understand the processes behind the neuropathological events occurring in the CNS of MS patients. The primary purpose of this review is to give the reader a global view of the main paradigms used in MS research, spacing from the classical animal models to transgenic mice and 2D and 3D cultures.},

Against this backdrop, this systematic review aimed to provide a broad overview of clinical, sociodemographic and psychosocial risk and protective factors for QoL in adults with MS and analyse psychological interventions for improving QoL. Method The literature search was conducted in the Scopus, Web of Science and ProQuest electronic databases. Document type was limited to articles written in English, published from January 1, 2014, to January 31, 2019. Information from the selected articles was extracted using a coding sheet and then qualitatively synthesised. Results The search identified 4886 records. After duplicate removal and screening, 106 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis and were assessed for study quality. Disability, fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment and unemployment were consistently identified as QoL risk factors, whereas higher self-esteem, self-efficacy, resilience and social support proved to be protective. The review analysed a wide spectrum of approaches for QoL psychological intervention, such as mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, self-help groups and self-management. The majority of interventions were successful in improving various aspects of QoL. Conclusion Adequate biopsychosocial assessment is of vital importance to treat risk and promote protective factors to improve QoL in patients with MS in general care practice.},

This disorder is a heterogeneous, multifactorial, immune-mediated disease that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. In most patients, reversible episodes of neurological dysfunction lasting several days or weeks characterize the initial stages of the disease (that is, clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing--remitting MS). Over time, irreversible clinical and cognitive deficits develop. A minority of patients have a progressive disease course from the onset. The pathological hallmark of MS is the formation of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which can be associated with neuro-axonal damage. Focal lesions are thought to be caused by the infiltration of immune cells, including T cells, B cells and myeloid cells, into the central nervous system parenchyma, with associated injury. MS is associated with a substantial burden on society owing to the high cost of the available treatments and poorer employment prospects and job retention for patients and their caregivers.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects worldwide about 2.5 million people. The morphological correlates of the disease are multiple lesions in brain and spinal cord which are characterized by demyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal damage. The underlying cause for the permanent neurological deficits in MS patients is axonal loss. Demyelinated axons are prone to damage due to the lack of trophic support by myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes, as well as the increased vulnerability to immune mediated attacks. Remyelination occurs, but especially in chronic lesions is frequently limited to a small rim at the lesion border. Current treatment strategies are based on anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory drugs and have the potential to reduce the numbers of newly evolving lesions, although as yet no treatment strategy exists to influence or prevent the progressive disease phase. Therefore, the development of neuroprotective treatment options, such as the promotion of endogenous remyelination is an attractive strategy. A prerequisite for the development of such new treatments is the understanding of the mechanisms leading to remyelination and the reasons for insufficient endogenous repair in chronic MS. This review will therefore provide an overview of the current concepts regarding remyelination in the rodent and human CNS. We will also summarize a selected number of inhibitory pathways and non-disease related factors which may contribute to remyelination failure in chronic MS.},

  abstract = {High-throughput 3{$\prime$} single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows cost-effective, detailed characterization of individual immune cells from tissues. Current techniques, however, are limited in their ability to elucidate essential immune cell features, including variable sequences of T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that confer antigen specificity. Here, we present a strategy that enables simultaneous analysis of TCR sequences and corresponding full transcriptomes from 3{$\prime$}-barcoded scRNA-seq samples. This approach is compatible with common 3{$\prime$} scRNA-seq methods, and adaptable to processed samples post hoc. We applied the technique to identify transcriptional signatures associated with T cells sharing common TCRs from immunized mice and from patients with food allergy. We observed preferential phenotypes among subsets of expanded clonotypes, including type 2 helper CD4+ T cell (TH2) states associated with food allergy. These results demonstrate the utility of our method when studying diseases in which clonotype-driven responses are critical to understanding the underlying biology.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) in humans is characterized by formation of immune-rich granulomas in infected tissues, the architecture and composition of which are thought to affect disease outcome. However, our understanding of the spatial relationships that control human granulomas is limited. Here, we used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) to image 37 proteins in tissues from patients with active TB. We constructed a comprehensive atlas that maps 19 cell subsets across 8 spatial microenvironments. This atlas shows an IFN-{$\gamma$}-depleted microenvironment enriched for TGF-{$\beta$}, regulatory T cells and IDO1+ PD-L1+ myeloid cells. In a further transcriptomic meta-analysis of peripheral blood from patients with TB, immunoregulatory trends mirror those identified by granuloma imaging. Notably, PD-L1 expression is associated with progression to active TB and treatment response. These data indicate that in TB granulomas, there are local spatially coordinated immunoregulatory programs with systemic manifestations that define active TB.},

  abstract = {The diversity of antigen receptors and the specificity it underlies are the hallmarks of the cellular arm of the adaptive immune system. T and B lymphocytes are indeed truly unique in their ability to generate receptors capable of recognizing virtually any pathogen. It has been known for several decades that T lymphocytes recognize short peptides derived from degraded proteins presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at the cell surface. Interaction between peptide-MHC (pMHC) and the T cell receptor (TCR) is central to both thymic selection and peripheral antigen recognition. It is widely assumed that TCR diversity is required, or at least highly desirable, to provide sufficient immune coverage. However, a number of immune responses are associated with the selection of predictable, narrow, or skewed repertoires and public TCR chains. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the formation of the TCR repertoire and its maintenance in health and disease. We also outline the various molecular mechanisms that govern the composition of the pre-selection, naive and antigen-specific TCR repertoires. Finally, we suggest that with the development of high-throughput sequencing, common TCR `signatures' raised against specific antigens could provide important diagnostic biomarkers and surrogate predictors of disease onset, progression and outcome.},

  abstract = {Dual TCR T cells are a common and natural product of TCR gene rearrangement and thymocyte development. As much as one third of the T cell population may have the capability to express two different TCR specificities on the cell surface. This discovery provoked a reconsideration of the classic model of thymic selection. Many potential roles for dual TCR T cells have since been hypothesized, including posing an autoimmune hazard, dominating alloreactive T cell responses, inducing allergy, and expanding the TCR repertoire to improve protective immunity. Yet, since the initial wave of publications following the discovery of dual TCR T cells, research in the area has slowed. In this study, we aim to provide a brief but comprehensive history of dual TCR T cell research, re-evaluate past observations in the context of current knowledge of the immune system, and identify key issues for future study.},

Numerous methods have been proposed to infer a directed acyclic graph (DAG) corresponding to the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) that captures causal gene relationships. However, existing models have restrictive assumptions (e.g. linearity, acyclicity), limited scalability, and/or fail to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.},

Here, we use single-cell multiomics, transgenic murine models, and functional approaches to define eTACs at the transcriptional, genomic, and proteomic level. We find that eTACs consist of two similar cell types: CCR7+ Aire-expressing migratory dendritic cells (AmDCs) and an Airehi population coexpressing Aire and retinoic acid receptor--related orphan receptor {$\gamma$}t (ROR{$\gamma$}t) that we term Janus cells (JCs). Both JCs and AmDCs have the highest transcriptional and genomic homology to CCR7+ migratory dendritic cells. eTACs, particularly JCs, have highly accessible chromatin and broad gene expression, including a range of tissue-specific antigens, as well as remarkable homology to medullary thymic epithelium and RANK-dependent Aire expression. Transgenic self-antigen expression by eTACs is sufficient to induce negative selection and prevent autoimmune diabetes. This transcriptional, genomic, and functional symmetry between eTACs (both JCs and AmDCs) and medullary thymic epithelium---the other principal Aire-expressing population and a key regulator of central tolerance---identifies a core program that may influence self-representation and tolerance across the spectrum of immune development.},
